Are You Interested Presenting an ACM SIGSOFT Webinar?

The webinar coordinators make it as easy as possible for anyone to give a webinar:

- fitting into any time and day that works for the presenter's schedule,
- having a very easy to use web-based interface,
- providing "dry run" training,
- requiring minimal resources (e.g., slides, title, abstract, and bio), and
optionally allowing the speaker to choose a moderator.

- Most webinars take place at 12pm US East Coast time and last an hour, with about 45 minutes of presentation and 10 minutes of Q/A time.

All presenters need are web access and a phone (or Skype) to provide a real-time audio feed while giving the talk (we provide the phone number - international numbers are also available).

The moderator (we can provide one, but presenters can request anyone they want) reads from a script we prepare that introduces the speaker and provides some administrative information, then handles Q/A.

We are open to several webinars - or a series of related webinars providing various degrees of details into your research. If you are interested in giving a webinar, please submit a proposal to Webinars (at) SIGSOFT (dot) org that includes the following information:

1. Title
2. Abstract
3. Speaker bio and photo
4. Moderator bio and photo (optional)


If selected, we need at least four weeks to do publicity.

Each webinar is recorded and available within 24 hours - but it stays behind the ACM firewall (meaning you have to "register for the webinar" to view it) for three months, after which time it posts to the ACM YouTube channel with open access.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us at Webinars (at) SIGSOFT (dot) org.

Thank you once again - and we look forward to hearing from you in the future.
