### What do professional software developers need to know to succeed in an age of Artificial Intelligence?

#### Abstract:

The media is replete with anxieties about software developers losing their jobs when Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of simpler developer tasks such as generating code. We arrive at a different conclusion based on our research with 21 industry developers on the cutting edge of using AI. Based on our findings, we argue that the risk is less around AI displacing the developer. Instead, the risk is that of the AI-augmented developer displacing the developer who neither reskill to keep up with AI tools nor upskill to be capable of realizing the productivity benefits that AI offers while managing AI’s risks. Our qualitative research draws on “Developing A CurriculUM” (DACUM), a methodology that has been widely used for job analysis, workforce training and the development of national occupational skills standards across more than 120 occupations in over 58 countries for more than 40 years.

In this talk, we first summarize how software development along the entire lifecycle is evolving as a result of AI impacting 12 broad developer goals, together with 75 associated tasks and the skills & knowledge corresponding to each task. We present a T-shaped framework that organizes all of these skills & knowledge into four domains, highlighting how imperative it is that developers both deepen and broaden their skills & knowledge to stay relevant in an age of AI. Next, we describe an AI task workflow that shows when and how these skills & knowledge need to be deployed in tandem for developers to use AI effectively. Finally, we show how K-12 educators, professors, workforce trainers, policy-makers and other leaders can use our 50-page occupational profile — a resource we are giving to the education community — to rethink Computer Science curricula for the AI era, so as to “future proof” current and future developers.

### Building Global Software Engineering Pipelines: Lessons from Bangladeshi Graduate Talent and LLM-Driven Research

#### Abstract
Bangladesh has emerged as a strong and reliable source of high-caliber graduate students in software engineering, with several universities producing candidates well prepared for advanced research in North America. This talk highlights the University of Saskatchewan’s experience recruiting and mentoring students from institutions such as Khulna University, Brac University, KUET, IUT, EWU, and CUET. Students from these institutes have excelled in areas including software clone detection, empirical studies, scientific workflows, diversity in software engineering, and data-driven development. Their contributions span automated clone benchmarking, large-scale analytics, tool explainability, and open-science replication studies that enhance research rigour and accessibility. The talk also examines the growing role of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering research and how Bangladeshi graduate students have integrated LLM-based techniques into work on bug localization, code summarization, clone detection, and peer code review support. Examples of publications and collaborations illustrate how LLMs are being used not only for automation but also for deeper insight, interpretability, and robust benchmarking. Broadening the view, the talk highlights the strong potential across many Bangladeshi universities and offers practical guidance on identifying promising applicants, building sustainable research pipelines, and fostering cross-border collaborations grounded in open science and methodological transparency. By synthesizing lessons learned and emerging opportunities, the talk encourages deeper engagement with Bangladeshi institutions and shows how expanded recruitment can enrich research programs, diversify perspectives, and strengthen the global software engineering community.

### Software Developer Accountability in the AI Era

#### Abstract
Being accountable to one’s teammates has positive effects on teamwork and efficiency. In this webinar, we introduce a series of studies we have conducted on the nature of accountability in software teams. We introduce the concepts of institutional and grassroots accountability, and expand on how intrinsic drivers of accountability, like pride in one’s code quality, impact team dynamics. We conclude by examining how the introduction of AI tools in code review influence these feelings of accountability. Our findings imply that the introduction of AI into SE must preserve social integrity and collective accountability mechanisms.

### Quantum Software Engineering: Building Dependable Software for Quantum Computers

#### Abstract
Quantum computers are becoming increasingly powerful and accessible. For instance, it is now possible to access IBM’s quantum computers of up to 156 qubits via cloud services through open access. This opens up new opportunities for building novel quantum computing applications, which are enabled through quantum software. However, developing dependable software that runs on quantum computers and delivers these applications requires new software engineering methods. To this end, a novel field of Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging. This talk will introduce the field of QSE, covering various aspects such as requirements engineering, modeling, coding, testing, and debugging of quantum software. Moreover, the talk will discuss how classical AI can potentially assist in QSE activities and briefly touch on quantum artificial intelligence, which holds the potential to help with QSE. Finally, the talk will conclude by discussing open research questions and the outlook for future work.

### Working with Non-Traditional Subjects; Lessons Learned from Using VR to Help Students with ADHD Focus


#### Abstract
Have you ever considered working with subjects other than traditional developers? For the past three years, we have done just that. We have found the journey full of new challenges and unexpected twists, but ultimately extremely rewarding. In this webinar we will detail our multi-year research project where we studied over 100 students with ADHD, helping them increase their focus on work using virtual reality headsets. Whether you are interested in studying students with ADHD, programmers with autism, or another non-traditional population, we walk you through the techniques and procedures, often outside of the typical computer scientists’ wheelhouse, that enabled our research. By the end of this webinar you will not only understand our findings on this particular project, you will understand what it takes to work with non-traditional subjects, populations that are often eager to engage with researchers and respond dramatically to the right interventions.

### From SBOM to Trusted Software Supply Chain: How Far Are We?
### Dec 13, 2022 7:00 PM Eastern Standard Time

[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/VUSq-KvgQco)

[Registration and more information](https://youtu.be/VUSq-KvgQco)

Speaker: Xin Xia, moderator: Xing Hu

Abstract:

The security and transparency of the software supply chain have been an emergency problem met by the government, industry, and academia. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), which records the ingredients that makeup software components, is widely used as a key building block to support the trusted software supply chain (TSSC). Except for SBOM, do we need to invent other technologies to support TSSC? What is the future road of TSSC? In this talk, I will present our recent progress in this area. I will introduce our initial works on SBOM generation and consumption, and then I will present our works relevant to vulnerability management (e.g., silent vulnerability bug reports and fixes identification, vulnerability detection, and CVE improvement) and supply chain attack prevention. Finally, I will briefly mention the future direction of TSSC.
