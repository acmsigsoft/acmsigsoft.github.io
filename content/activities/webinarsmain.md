### Quantum Software Engineering: Building Dependable Software for Quantum Computers

#### abstract
Quantum computers are becoming increasingly powerful and accessible. For instance, it is now possible to access IBM’s quantum computers of up to 156 qubits via cloud services through open access. This opens up new opportunities for building novel quantum computing applications, which are enabled through quantum software. However, developing dependable software that runs on quantum computers and delivers these applications requires new software engineering methods. To this end, a novel field of Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging. This talk will introduce the field of QSE, covering various aspects such as requirements engineering, modeling, coding, testing, and debugging of quantum software. Moreover, the talk will discuss how classical AI can potentially assist in QSE activities and briefly touch on quantum artificial intelligence, which holds the potential to help with QSE. Finally, the talk will conclude by discussing open research questions and the outlook for future work.

### Working with Non-Traditional Subjects; Lessons Learned from Using VR to Help Students with ADHD Focus


#### Abstract
Have you ever considered working with subjects other than traditional developers? For the past three years, we have done just that. We have found the journey full of new challenges and unexpected twists, but ultimately extremely rewarding. In this webinar we will detail our multi-year research project where we studied over 100 students with ADHD, helping them increase their focus on work using virtual reality headsets. Whether you are interested in studying students with ADHD, programmers with autism, or another non-traditional population, we walk you through the techniques and procedures, often outside of the typical computer scientists’ wheelhouse, that enabled our research. By the end of this webinar you will not only understand our findings on this particular project, you will understand what it takes to work with non-traditional subjects, populations that are often eager to engage with researchers and respond dramatically to the right interventions.

### From SBOM to Trusted Software Supply Chain: How Far Are We?
### Dec 13, 2022 7:00 PM Eastern Standard Time

[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/VUSq-KvgQco)

[Registration and more information](https://youtu.be/VUSq-KvgQco)

Speaker: Xin Xia, moderator: Xing Hu

Abstract:

The security and transparency of the software supply chain have been an emergency problem met by the government, industry, and academia. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), which records the ingredients that makeup software components, is widely used as a key building block to support the trusted software supply chain (TSSC). Except for SBOM, do we need to invent other technologies to support TSSC? What is the future road of TSSC? In this talk, I will present our recent progress in this area. I will introduce our initial works on SBOM generation and consumption, and then I will present our works relevant to vulnerability management (e.g., silent vulnerability bug reports and fixes identification, vulnerability detection, and CVE improvement) and supply chain attack prevention. Finally, I will briefly mention the future direction of TSSC.
