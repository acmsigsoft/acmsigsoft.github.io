To be eligible for nomination for the award, individuals' most recent computer-related educational degree (baccalaureate, masters, or doctoral degree) must have been awarded no more than seven years prior to the date of nomination. The 7-year window may be extended for extenuating circumstances such as parental or medical leave. Extenuating circumstances must be described in the nomination statement for the committee's deliberation (the committee reserves the right to accept or deny the consideration of the extenuating circumstances).

The award recipient receives a $1000 honorarium and a plaque engraved with their name and signed by the chair of SIGSOFT. The award is announced by the SIGSOFT chair at ICSE during ICSE's award presentation session. Each award recipient also receives travel support up to $2500 within their home continent and up to $3000 outside their home continent, including airfare, hotel, and conference registration to attend ICSE.

To submit a nomination for the award, please use the awards nomination portal. Nominations are due no later than January 15 of each year. Among other details, the nominator needs to submit the following through the portal:

1. The proposed citation (up to 25 words)
2. Succinct description of why the nominee is well-qualified for the award (100-250 words)
3. Detailed nomination statement (no length limit, but please be reasonable) that includes the following sentence: "To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM's Core Values."

The nominator also needs to upload up to 3 support letters (200-300 words will be sufficient for each support letter, although longer statements of support are of course welcome). Each support letter must include the following sentence: "To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM's Core Values."
