title: " Distinguished Service Award "
---

This annual award is presented to individuals who have contributed dedicated and important service to the software engineering community. The award typically goes to a single person but can also be assigned to multiple people for joint contributions.

Recipients receive a plaque engraved with their name and signed by the chair of SIGSOFT and share a $1000 honorarium. The award is presented by the SIGSOFT chair at ICSE during ICSE's award presentation session. The award recipient(s) each receive support for travel to ICSE up to $2500 within their home continent and up to $3000 outside their home continent, including airfare, hotel, and conference registration for ICSE.

The selection committee solicits nominations from the software engineering community in a variety of ways including announcements in SIGSOFT's newsletter, Software Engineering Notes, and postings on appropriate newsgroups and websites. The committee considers all external nominations in the context of the nominees' specific and general service contributions to the overall software engineering community. The selection committee shall have the option to decline to make an award in a given year, if no suitable nominations are presented.

Criteria that the committee considers in evaluating nominations include:

1. Service to ACM SIGSOFT
2. Service to the software engineering community outside of SIGSOFT
3. Service to broadening participation of underrepresented groups in software engineering
4. Service to students
5. Length of time serving the software engineering community
6. Other service contributions

To submit a nomination for the award, please use the awards [nomination portal](https://awards.sigsoft.org/). Nominations are due no later than January 15 of each year. Among other details, the nominator needs to submit the following through the portal:

1. The proposed citation (up to 25 words)
2. Succinct description of why the nominee is well-qualified for the award (100-250 words)
3. Detailed nomination statement (no length limit, but please be reasonable) that includes the following sentence: "To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM's Core Values."

The nominator also needs to upload up to 3 support letters (200-300 words will be sufficient for each support letter, although longer statements of support are of course welcome). Each support letter must include the following sentence: "To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM's Core Values."
