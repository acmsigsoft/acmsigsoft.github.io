The ACM SIGSOFT Improving Paper and Peer Review Quality Initiative
==================================================================

In May 2019, ACM SIGSOFT launched an initiative to improve the quality of research papers and peer reviews at software engineering venues. The initiative is co-chaired by [Paul Ralph](http://paulralph.name/) (Dalhousie University) and [Romain Robbes](https://www.inf.unibz.it/~rrobbes/) (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano).

The Initiative seeks to improve the quality of papers and peer reviews by generating and evolving _empirical standards_: brief, public documents that describe expectations for a certain kind of study. These standards are not vague criteria like "soundness" and "presentation." They list specific practices like random assignment (for experiments) and reference snowballing (for systematic reviews).

[Preliminary standards](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards) were announced in October 2020. All active researchers are encouraged to review the standards relevant to their research programs and report any potential problems or oversights by [submitting an issue to the GitHub repo](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/issues). More standards are in development. 
To volunteer to contribute, [contact Paul Ralph](https://paulralph.name). You do not have to be a member of ACM or SIGSOFT to report an issue or contribute to the standards.

A detailed report, explaining how the standards were generated and how they should be used is also available from [the repo](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards).

Any scholarly venue can adopt these standards. Representatives of journals, conferences or other venues who would like to explore adopting the standards should [contact us directly](/contact)
