Obtaining Visas for Travel to US Events
---------------------------------------

Some international visitors will need to obtain a visa for travel to the U.S. The latest official information on visas for foreign citizens can be found on the [U.S. Department of State website](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en.html). Since the visa process may vary from country to country, it is best to start the process as early as possible to be able to satisfy all requirements and paperwork.

The visa that conference attendees are most likely to need is the [Business Visitor B-1 Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/business.html).

It is important that you be able to demonstrate your intent to return home. This link gives more information on this topic. In general, a round-trip ticket is helpful but not sufficient for proving your intent to return home.

ACM and SIGSOFT do not issue formal invitation letters for visas. However, the ACM can issue a [visa support letter](http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/visas).

Often it is helpful to find the website for the specific embassy location where you will be applying for a visa. These sites tend to have specific information on turnaround time, necessary paperwork, and so on.

Student Travel Support and Child Care Assistance at Conferences - CAPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

SIGSOFT's [CAPS program](/activities/CAPSMAIN) offers financial assistance to support travel and participation at conferences by SIGSOFT student members, professional members, and non-member undergraduate students.

SEWORLD Mailing List
--------------------

The [SEWORLD mailing list](/seworld) is provided as a service to the Software Engineering community. It can be used for distributing time-sensitive material such as announcements of events and available positions.

Open TOC
--------

[Open TOC](/opentoc), the Open Table of Contents, is a list of open access conference proceedings. It provides access to the proceedings papers in the ACM Digital Library for one year from the conference start date.

Webinars
--------

SIGSOFT and ACM Professional Development sponsor free [webinars](/activities/webinarsmain) on current topics. You can register for upcoming webinars and access past events.

Impact Project
--------------

The [Impact Project](/impact/impact) seeks to determine the impact of software engineering research upon software engineering practice. The project organizes volunteers who are among the world's most eminent software engineering researchers and practitioners to develop solidly researched documentation that will aid future research, education, and technology transition.
