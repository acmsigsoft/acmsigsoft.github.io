# SIGSOFT Annual Report

## Fiscal Year 2016

## Submitted by: Nenad Medvidovic, SIGSOFT Chair

*SIGSOFT seeks to improve our ability to engineer software by
stimulating interaction among practitioners, researchers, and educators;
by fostering the professional development of software engineers; and by
representing software engineers to professional, legal, and political
entities.*

ACM\'s SIGSOFT had another excellent year, both technically and
financially in 2015-2016. This report provides a summary of key SIGSOFT
activities over the past year.

AWARDS GIVEN OUT

SIGSOFT\'s awards program recognizes the many achievements of the
software engineering community (see http://www.sigsoft.org/ for the most
recent awardees). A number of the awards, including our prestigious
service, research, and education awards, were presented again this year
at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2016) in
Austin, TX.

-   The ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award was presented to James
    Herbsleb from Carnegie Melon University, USA, \"for his significant
    and lasting research contributions to the theory and practice of
    software engineering.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award was presented to Lori
    Pollock from the University of Delaware, USA, \"for her
    contributions to the advancement of the research and practice of
    software engineering.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award was presented to Martin
    Glinz from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, \"for his key
    service contributions to the software engineering community,
    including major editorial responsibilities in journals and
    successful chairing of major technical events.\"
-   The Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award was given to Milos
    Gligoric, for his Ph.D. dissertation titled \"Regression Test
    Selection: Theory and Practice.\" The dissertation was completed at
    the University of Illinois, under the guidance of Professor Darko
    Marinov.
-   We recognized the new ACM Senior Members, Distinguished Members, and
    Fellows from the SIGSOFT community. In particular, the new
    Distinguished Members are Margaret Burnett, Nenad Medvidovic,
    Nachiappan Nagappan, Sebastian Uchitel, and Tao Xie. The new ACM
    Fellows are Michael Franz, Sriram Rajamani, and Michael Rung-Tsong
    Lyu.
-   The SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award recognizes a paper published in a
    SIGSOFT conference at least 10 years earlier that has had
    exceptional impact on research or practice. This year, the award
    went to the paper \"Finding Bugs with a Constraint Solver\" by
    Daniel Jackson and Mandana Vaziri, from the Proceedings of the 2000
    ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis
    (ISSTA 2000).
-   The Impact Paper Award is in addition to the Most Influential Paper
    Awards, also known as \"test of time awards\", which are given to
    papers that have appeared at a particular conference. ICSE is the
    SIGSOFT co-sponsored conference with the longest track record of
    awarding Most Influential Papers. This year, the award went to the
    ICSE 2006 paper \"Who Should Fix This Bug?\" by John Anvik, Lyndon
    Hiew, and Gail Murphy.
-   Many of SIGSOFT\'s sponsored meetings this year also presented
    Distinguished Paper Awards. SIGSOFT allows up to 10% of the accepted
    papers to be selected for this award. The list of awarded papers is
    maintained on SIGSOFT website\'s Awards page.

SIGNIFICANT PAPERS ON NEW AREAS

Software engineering has become a truly interdisciplinary area as every
facet of computing, as well as many other scientific and engineering
disciplines, depend on software. Advances in these other areas-from big
data, to the cloud, virtualization, deep learning, mobile computing,
formal methods, etc., with applications in autonomous vehicles,
robotics, medicine, and countless other areas-require corresponding
software engineering methods, tools, and techniques. This is reflected
in the types of papers that increasingly appear in software engineering
venues sponsored by SIGSOFT. Such papers tend to combine advances in
multiple areas into solutions to specific problems. As examples, we
highlight two such papers, recipients of the SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper
Award at ICSE 2016.

-   \"Efficient Large-scale Trace Checking Using MapReduce\" by Marcello
    Bersani, Domenico Bianculli, Carlo Ghezzi, Srdjan Krstic, and
    Piearluigi San Pietro demonstrates an effective marriage of cloud
    computing, distributed programming frameworks, and temporal logic.
-   \"VDTest: An Automated Framework to Support Testing for Virtual
    Devices\" by Tingting Yu, Xiao Qu, and Myra Cohen demonstrates a
    novel coupling of formal methods, static program analysis, software
    testing, and virtualization.

INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS

Over the past several years, SIGSOFT has introduced a number of programs
to aid and expand our membership. Some representative examples are as
follows: student-members receive discounted membership rates and
registration fees at all SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences; most of our
conferences offer Doctoral Symposia where students are mentored by
experienced Software Engineering professors; the popular SIGSOFT Webinar
series (in the past year, we have had 11 webinars that had a total of
2,875 attendees); an Early Career Award that recognizes individuals at
early stages in their careers; SIGSOFT provides travel support to
conferences for dozens of graduate and undergraduate student-members as
well as support to defray the costs of childcare, through the Conference
Aid Program for Students (CAPS).

To broaden SIGSOFT\'s reach and membership, SIGSOFT has established
national chapters in India (ISoft) and China (CSoft). Each chapter has a
liaison on the SIGSOFT EC. As part of the support for the two
communities, SIGSOFT sponsors travel for a total of four SIGSOFT
Distinguished Paper Award winning authors to present their work at
ISoft\'s and CSoft\'s flagship national events (two at each event).
Furthermore, SIGSOFT has sponsored travel for two speakers at each of
the three annual Warm-up Workshops organized to expose the Latin
American software engineering community to ICSE, which will be held in
Buenos Aires in 2017.

KEY ISSUES FACING SIGSOFT

While SIGSOFT is stable and strong, there are several challenges we are
facing:

-   SIGSOFT\'s membership numbers have been stable despite a large
    growth of software engineering worldwide. We will aim to address
    this, with a particular focus on practitioners.
-   We will work on establishing a long-term working relationship with
    our Indian, Chinese, and South American colleagues, as well as
    expanding the reach of SIGSOFT into Africa.
-   The typical conference registration fees place a significant burden
    on the research funds of many members of our community. SIGSOFT has
    tried to alleviate this burden through the CAPS program. We will
    work on developing ways of reducing the fees more directly.
-   We recognize that traditional ways of reaching our membership are no
    longer sufficient. To address that, we will work on increasing
    SIGSOFT\'s presence on social media.
