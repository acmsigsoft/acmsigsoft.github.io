# SIGSOFT Annual Report

## July 2013 - June 2014

## Submitted by: Will Tracz, SIGSOFT Chair

ACM\'s Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT) had
another excellent year, both technically and financially in 2013 - 14.
This report provides a summary of key SIGSOFT activities over the past
year.

AWARDS THAT WERE GIVEN OUT

SIGSOFT has a large awards program that recognizes the many achievements
of the software engineering community (see http://www.sigsoft.org/).

Our prestigious service, research and education awards were presented
again this year at the International Conference on Software Engineering
(ICSE) 2014 in Hyderabad, India. The recipients are as follows:

The ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award was presented to: Leon J.
Osterweil from the University of Massachusetts, \"For promoting and
expanding the field of software engineering through visionary leadership
of the Impact Project and for bringing the community to China, and China
into the community, by organizing ICSE 2006 in Shanghai, as well as
sustained editorial, program, and award committee service.\"

The ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award was presented to Alexander L.
Wolf from Imperial College, \"For formative work in software
architecture, influential research in distributed event - based systems,
and important contributions in software deployment, configuration
management, and process.\"

The ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award was presented to Mary Lou
Soffa from the University of Virginia \"For a sustained record of
teaching and mentoring students at all ranks in the field of computing,
especially in software engineering, with half of the mentored students
being women or minorities.\"

At ICSE 2014 we also recognized new ACM Senior Members, ACM
Distinguished Members and ACM Fellows for 2014 from the SIGSOFT
community.

-   The new ACM Senior Members are Punam Bedi, Cormac Flanagan, Cory
    Plock, Manu Sridharan, Masao Ito, Thomas Zimmermann, and Vicente
    Ferreira de Lucena Jr.
-   Distinguished Members: André van der Hoek and Gregg E. Rothermel
    were recognized as new ACM Distinguished Scientists. Owen Astrachan
    was recogni zed as a Distinguished Educator
-   This year there was only one SIGSOFT member who was named an ACM
    Fellow - David Garlan of Carnegie Mellon University \"For
    contributions to the development of software architecture as a
    discipline in software engineering.\"

The SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award recognizes a paper published in a SIGSOFT
conference at least 10 years earlier that has had exceptional impact on
research or practice. The 2014 SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award committee, led
by Peri Tarr, selected the paper: \"Evidence - based Software
Engineering\" by Barbara A. Kitchenham, Tore Dybå, Magne Jørgensen, from
the Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Software
Engineering (ICSE \'04).

This is the second year for the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Doctoral
Dissertation Award for the outstanding PhD dissertations in the field of
software engineering. This year\'s awardee was Jeff Huang for his
dissertation \"Effective Methods for Debugging Concurrent Software.\"
Huang\'s research developed new algorithms and tools to make programmers
much more productive in finding, understanding, and fixing software bugs
that particularly pertain to concurrent programs that simultaneously use
multiple cores. Huang completed his Ph.D. at the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology, China, advised by Professor Charles Zhang.

Many of our sponsored meetings this year also presented ACM SIGSOFT
Distinguished Paper Awards to the authors of a select number of their
accepted papers. The awardees are listed in next section.

SIGNIFICANT PAPERS ON NEW AREAS THAT WERE PUBLISHED IN PROCEEDINGS

The problems and topics addressed in the papers presented at SIGSOFT
meetings remain varied and timely. Software engineering researchers are
increasing their application of techniques borrowed from other areas of
computer science, particularly virtualization, mobile computing, and
human/computer interac tion. The acceptance rates have been around the
20 - 25% range with SIGSOFT Distinguished paper awards ratio being up to
1 award for every 10 accepted papers. ESEC/FSE had 251 submissions with
51 papers accepted (20%) but there were no Distinguished Paper Awards.
ICSE had 499 submission with 99 papers accepted (20%) that resulted in
ten Distinguished Papers Awards, of which the following provided
innovative insights.

-   Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How is Video Game
    Development Different fro m Software Development? by Emerson
    Murphy-Hill, Thomas Zimmermann, and Nachiappan Nagappan
-   Characterizing and Detecting Performance Bugs for Smartphone
    Applications by Yepang Liu, Chang Xu, and Shing-Chi Cheung
-   Improving Automated Source Code Summarization via an Eye - Tracking
    Study of Programmers by Paige Rodeghero, Collin McMillan, Paul W.
    McBurney, Nigel Bosch, and Sidney D\'Mello
-   Unit Test Virtualization with VMVM by Jonathan Bell and Gail Kaiser
-   Coverage Is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness by
    Laura Inozemtseva and Reid Holmes

ISSTA had three Distinguished Paper Awards based on 124 submissions with
32 accepted (26%).

SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDED A SPRINGBOARD FOR FURTHER TECHNICAL
EFFORTS

SIGSOFT has two software engineering education programs - one targeted
toward students and the seconded focused on educators. Students receive
discounted membership rates and registration fees at all SIGSOFT -
sponsored conferences and workshops. In addition, our two flagship
conferences: ICSE and ESEC/FSE offer a Doctoral Symposium where students
are mentored by experienced Software Engineering professors. Also,
SIGSOFT provides travel support to SIGSOFT sponsored or co-sponsored
conferences or workshops for graduate and undergraduate students who are
SIGSOFT members through the Conference Aid Program for Students (CAPS) -
http://www.sigsoft.org/CAPS/. Attendance at conferences and workshops to
present papers and to interact with researchers and practitioners in
software engineering is an important component of students\' education
and professional development. Moreover, students\' presence at
conferences and workshops enriches and broadens conference and workshop
activities. Conferences and workshops are also a good way to introduce
students to the services of SIGSOFT. In FY 2014 over \$70K of grants
were given to 71 graduate and 6 undergraduate students (out of 131
requests).

SIGSOFT holds Software Engineering Educators Symposium (SEES) in non
ESEC/FSE years. It consists of two half-day tutorials covering
approaches for teaching programming and software engineering to
undergraduates. Symposium participants are provided access to
instructional materials, receive practical tips on how to successfully
apply the approaches, and learned about tools that support hands - on
instruction and active learning. ACM SIGSOFT is providing funding for
this year\'s FSE in Hong Kong.

INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE SERVICE TO SOME PART OF THE TECHNICAL
COMMUNITY

This year we expanded the Award Nomination Submission web site to handle
all award submissions and evaluations. In addition we \"normalized\" all
awards so that there is a single submission deadline. The use of the
website proved very beneficial and it will be cloned and expanded to
handle SEN submissions in 2015.

Another innovation is the SIGSOFT Webinar Series, which will be open to
the general software engineering community. Webinars will be based on
the Future of Software Engineering Track at ICSE 2014. Kevin Sullivan at
the University of Virginia is leading this effort.

Finally, jointly used by SIGSOFT/SIGPLAN tool, PCMiner was made
available all SIGS at the SGB meeting. Program chairs can used it to
identify suitable candidates to serve on their program committees.
Steering committees can use it to identify suitable candidates to serve
as program chair or general chair.

Broadening Participation Events/Program

In order to increase participation in SIGSOFT-sponsored events and
increase/retain membership, we:

-   Raised/Lowered SIGSOFT Membership fees by creating an
    electronic-only category of membership.
-   Explored conference profit sharing as a means to reduce conference
    registration fees
-   Increased CAPS support funding by \$10K to provide additional travel
    assistance for student conference attendance
-   Created six issues of SEN with over 100 papers, columns, and book
    reviews being added to the Digital Library. Our publication policy
    increases early dissemination of research and our mentoring process
    on editing submissions helps new authors develop better
    communication skills.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF KEY ISSUES FACING THE SIGSOFT MEMBERSHIP

Challenges for the years to come include:

-   Increasing the number of award nominations
-   Reducing conference/workshop registration fees
-   Providing more resources to practitioners
-   Increasing use of social media
-   Increasing volunteer involvement and development.
