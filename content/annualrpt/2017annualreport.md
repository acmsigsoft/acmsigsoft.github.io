# SIGSOFT Annual Report

## Fiscal Year 2017

## Submitted by Nenad Medvidovic, SIGSOFT Chair

*SIGSOFT seeks to improve our ability to engineer software by
stimulating interaction among practitioners, researchers, and educators;
by fostering the professional development of software engineers; and by
representing software engineers to professional, legal, and political
entities.*

ACM\'s SIGSOFT had another excellent year, both technically and
financially in 2016-2017. This report provides a summary of key SIGSOFT
activities over the past year.

AWARDS GIVEN OUT

SIGSOFT\'s awards program recognizes the many achievements of the
software engineering community (see http://www.sigsoft.org/ for the most
recent awardees). A number of the awards, including our prestigious
service, research, and education awards, were presented again this year
at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2017) in
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

-   The ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award was presented to Daniel
    Jackson from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, \"for
    foundational contributions to software modeling, the creation of the
    modeling language Alloy, and the development of a widely used tool
    supporting model verification.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award was presented to Bertrand
    Meyer from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, Innopolis University,
    Russia, University of Toulouse, France, and ETH Zurich, Switzerland,
    \"for his contributions to the advancement of the research and
    practice of software engineering.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award was presented to Laura
    Dillon from Michigan State University, \"for outstanding leadership
    and service to the software engineering research community and to
    broadening participation in computing.\"
-   The inaugural ACM SIGSOFT Early Career Research Award was presented
    to Christian Bird from Microsoft Research, USA, \"for outstanding
    contributions in the area of software engineering as an early career
    investigator.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award was given to
    Srdjan Krstic, for his Ph.D. dissertation titled \"Trace Checking of
    Quantitative Properties.\" The dissertation was completed at
    Politecnico di Milano, Italy, under the guidance of Professor Carlo
    Ghezzi.
-   We recognized the new ACM Senior Members, Distinguished Members, and
    Fellows from the SIGSOFT community. In particular, the new
    Distinguished Members are Joanne Atlee, Tevfik Bultan, Sebastian
    Elbaum, and Shing-Chi Cheung. The new ACM Fellow is Daniel Jackson.
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award recognizes a paper published in a
    SIGSOFT conference at least 10 years earlier that has had
    exceptional impact on research or practice. This year, the award
    went to the paper \"Principled design of the modern Web
    architecture\" by Roy T. Fielding and Richard N. Taylor, published
    in Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Software
    Engineering (ICSE 2000).
-   The Impact Paper Award is in addition to the Most Influential Paper
    Awards, also known as \"test of time awards\", which are given to
    papers that have appeared at a particular conference. ICSE is the
    SIGSOFT co-sponsored conference with the longest track record of
    awarding Most Influential Papers. This year, the award went to the
    ICSE 2007 paper Feedback-Directed Random Test Generation by Carlos
    Pacheco, Shuvendu K. Lahiri, Michael D. Ernst, and Thomas Ball.
-   Many of SIGSOFT\'s sponsored meetings this year also presented
    Distinguished Paper Awards. SIGSOFT allows up to 10% of the accepted
    papers to be selected for this award. The list of awarded papers is
    maintained on SIGSOFT website\'s Awards page.

SIGNIFICANT PAPERS ON NEW AREAS

Software engineering has traditionally been an interdisciplinary area,
branching into a range of different application domains as well as other
research areas in computer science, such as human-computer interaction,
mobile computing, artificial intelligence, distributed systems, more
recently big data and machine learning, and so on. This is because every
facet of computing, as well as many other scientific and engineering
disciplines, depend on software. Advances in these other areas mentioned
above - from big data, to the cloud, virtualization, deep learning,
mobile computing, formal methods, computer security, etc., with
applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, medicine, and countless
other areas - require corresponding software engineering methods, tools,
and techniques. This is reflected in the types of papers that
increasingly appear in software engineering venues sponsored by SIGSOFT.
Such papers tend to combine advances in multiple areas into solutions to
specific problems. As examples, we highlight two such papers, the first
a recipient of the SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the Symposium on
the Foundations of Software Engineering, held in November 2016 in
Seattle, USA (FSE 2016), and the second a recipient of the same award at
the International Conference on Software Engineering, held in May 2017
in Buenos Aires, Argentina (ICSE 2017):

-   \"Multi-Representational Security Analysis\" by Eunsuk Kang,
    Aleksandar Milicevic, and Daniel Jackson presented a technique for
    end-to-end security analysis by composing multiple models of a
    system, including early (e.g., design) models.
-   \"Decoding the representation of code in the brain: An fMRI study of
    code review and expertise\" by Benjamin Floyd, Tyler Santander, and
    Westley Weimer showed how functional magnetic resonance imaging
    (fMRI) can be used to study code comprehension by software
    developers.

We have decided to highlight these two papers as a way of demonstrating
the breadth of topics that are commonly covered in SIGSOFT-sponsored
conferences today.

INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS

Over the past several years, SIGSOFT has introduced a number of programs
to aid and expand our membership. Some representative examples are as
follows. Our student-members receive discounted membership rates and
significantly discounted registration fees at all SIGSOFT-sponsored
conferences. Most of our conferences offer Doctoral Symposia where
students are mentored by experienced Software Engineering professors.
The SIGSOFT Webinar series has become quite popular; in the past year,
which had a lighter slate than usual that included only 4 webinars we
still had a total of 1,486 attendees both live and on-demand. We
recently introduced the Early Career Award that recognizes individuals
at early stages in their careers; the past year was the inaugural year
of the Early Career Award. SIGSOFT provides travel support to
conferences for dozens of graduate and undergraduate student-members as
well as support to defray the costs of childcare for all members of our
community (faculty qualify as well), through the Conference Aid Program
for Students (CAPS); as of this year, CAPS will be extended to help
defray travel costs of a certain number of post-doctoral researchers.

To broaden SIGSOFT\'s reach and membership, SIGSOFT has established
national chapters in India (ISoft) and China (CSoft). Each chapter has a
liaison on the SIGSOFT EC, in addition to our long-standing
International Liaison. As part of the support for these two communities
specifically, SIGSOFT sponsors travel for a total of four SIGSOFT
Distinguished Paper Award winning authors to present their work at
ISoft\'s and CSoft\'s flagship national events (two at each event). The
success of this program is reflected in this year\'s decision by the
organizers of ISEC 2017, ISoft\'s premier event, to fund the attendance
and presentation of two additional SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award
winners. Furthermore, SIGSOFT has sponsored travel for two speakers at
each of the three annual Warm-up Workshops organized to expose the Latin
American software engineering community to ICSE, which was held in
Buenos Aires in 2017. SIGSOFT is currently in discussions with the
organizers of ICSE 2017 to sponsor a post-mortem event for the Latin
American software engineering community.

KEY ISSUES FACING SIGSOFT

While SIGSOFT is stable and strong, there are several challenges we
continue to face:

-   SIGSOFT\'s membership numbers have been stable despite a large
    growth of software engineering worldwide. We will aim to address
    this, with a particular focus on practitioners. To this end, we
    already have a couple of programs in place, but we will need to
    better utilize SIGSOFT\'s Industry Liaison.
-   We will continue to work on establishing a long-term working
    relationship with our Indian, Chinese, and South American
    colleagues, as well as expanding the reach of SIGSOFT into Africa.
    While we have had some success in this regard, there is significant
    room for further growth.
-   The typical conference registration fees place a significant burden
    on the research funds of many members of our community. SIGSOFT has
    tried to alleviate this burden through the CAPS program. We will
    work on developing ways of reducing the fees more directly. SIGSOFT
    is currently working on developing a model to return conference
    surpluses to future editions of the same conference, in a way that
    will directly apply to reduced registration fees.
-   We recognize that traditional ways of reaching our membership are no
    longer sufficient. To address that, we will work on increasing
    SIGSOFT\'s presence on social media. In addition to the elected
    SIGSOFT Executive Committee Member-at-Large who serves in the role
    of Social Media Chair, we have recently appointed a Deputy Social
    Media Chair in order to increase and improve our presence in this
    area.
