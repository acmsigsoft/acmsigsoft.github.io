# SIGSOFT Annual Report

## Fiscal Year 2020, July 2019 - June 2020

## Submitted by Thomas Zimmermann, SIGSOFT Chair

*SIGSOFT seeks to improve our ability to engineer software by
stimulating interaction among practitioners, researchers, and educators;
by fostering the professional development of software engineers; and by
representing software engineers to professional, legal, and political
entities.*

This report provides a summary of key SIGSOFT activities over the past
year. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the world and
also the SE community. Our hearts go out to all those affected by
COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, students and professors
switched to online teaching, software engineers now work from home, and
many conferences had to be cancelled or switched to virtual formats.
It's difficult to predict the long-term effects of the pandemic but
SIGSOFT remains committed to support its members during this difficult
time. On a positive note, despite the pandemic, the SIGSOFT community
had a strong technical year with many significant contributions and
SIGSOFT remains financially healthy.

**AWARDS GIVEN OUT**

The SIGSOFT awards program recognizes the many achievements of the
software engineering community.

-   The ACM SIGSOFT **Outstanding Research Award** was presented to
    **Michael Ernst** for *contributions to programmer productivity
    through software analysis, testing and verification*.
-   The ACM SIGSOFT **Influential Educator Award** was presented to
    **Greg Wilson** for *life-long contributions to software engineering
    education throughout the computing industry*.
-   The ACM SIGSOFT **Distinguished Service Award** was presented to
    **Nenad Medvidović** for *significant service to the software
    engineering community and for leading important community
    innovations*.

    presented to **Rachel Tzoref-Brill**, Tel Aviv University, for *the
    thesis Comprehension and Evolution of Combinatorial Models and Test
    Plans*.
-   The ACM SIGSOFT **Impact Paper Award** recognizes a paper published
    in a SIGSOFT conference at least 10 years earlier that has had
    exceptional impact on research or practice. This year, the award
    went to the paper Model Checking Programs, authored by **Willem
    Visser, Klaus Havelund, Guillaume Brat and SeungJoon Park**,
    published in the Proceedings of the 15th IEEE International
    Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2000, Grenoble,
    France, 11-15 Sep 2000).

In addition to the Impact Paper Award, many SIGSOFT conferences also
have **Most Influential Paper Awards**, also known as \"test of time
awards\", which are given to papers that have appeared at a particular
conference. At ICSE the SIGSOFT co-sponsored conference with the longest
track record of awarding Most Influential Papers, the award went to the
ICSE 2010 paper \"Oracle-Guided Component-Based Program Synthesis\", by
**Susmit Jha, Sumit Gulwani, Sanjit A. Seshia, Ashish Tiwari**. The
ESEC/FSE conference recognized two papers from ESEC/FSE 2009: \"Fair and
balanced?: Bias in Bug-fix Datasets\", by **Christian Bird, Adrian
Bachmann, Eirik Aune, John Duffy, Abraham Bernstein, Vladimir Filkov,
Premkumar Devanbu** and \"Cross-project Defect Prediction: A Large Scale
Experiment on Data vs. Domain vs. Process\", by **Thomas Zimmermann,
Nachiappan Nagappan, Harald Gall, Emanuel Giger, Brendan Murphy**.

We recognized the new ACM Distinguished Members and Fellows from the
SIGSOFT community. **Valerie Barr, Andrew B. Begel, Eric Bodden, Yuriy
Brun, David Lo, Shan Lu, Manu Sridharan** have been elevated to
**Distinguished Member**; and **Matthew B. Dwyer** has been elevated to
**ACM Fellow** for contributions to the specification and analysis of
software.

Many of SIGSOFT's sponsored meetings also presented **Distinguished
Paper Awards**. SIGSOFT allows up to 10% of the accepted papers to be
selected for this award. The list of recognized papers is available at
[here](/awards/distinguishedpaper).

**SIGNIFICANT PAPERS ON NEW AREAS**

Software plays a prominent role in different application domains as well
as other research areas in computer science, such as human-computer
interaction, mobile computing, artificial intelligence, distributed
systems, and more recently big data and machine learning. Everything
depends on software today. As examples for the breadth of the software
engineering field, we highlight below distinguished papers from the
ESEC/FSE 2019 and ICSE 2020, two of the main general software
engineering conferences sponsored by SIGSOFT. The trend over the past
few years to adopt machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) in software has continued. This has led to research both on
leveraging ML and AI to improve the way software is being built (AI4SE),
but also to research that incorporate SE concepts into ML and AI
processes and workflows (SE4AI). An increased emphasis has been placed
on testing and debugging systems that are based on ML and AI. Automated
program repair, test generation, and reproducing bugs continue to remain
popular topics in the SE research community. In recent years a strong
focus was placed on better understanding software developers. Two
examples of papers in this area are on understanding how developers
learn new languages and how cognitive biases influence decision making.
Over the next few years it can be expected that the SE community will
make further progress on being able to build more reliable, robust and
fair software systems at a larger scale, while increasing the
productivity of software developers at the same time.

**SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS**

Over the past several years, SIGSOFT has introduced several programs to
aid and expand our membership. Two signature programs are the Webinars
and the CAPS funding.

-   The SIGSOFT **Webinar series** remains very popular; in the past
    year, SIGSOFT organized five webinars on topics such as joys and
    frustration of software engineering, automated debugging and
    profiling of AAA games, agile development, and continuous
    integration and delivery.
-   Through the **Conference Aid Program for Students (CAPS)**, SIGSOFT
    provided travel support to conferences for dozens of graduate and
    undergraduate student-members as well as support to defray the costs
    of childcare for all members of our community (faculty qualify as
    well). CAPS has been extended to help defray travel costs of a
    certain number of professional SIGSOFT members as well. The new
    program launched in Fall 2019. Overall the CAPS support allocation
    was doubled in 2019-2020.

SIGSOFT continued the implementation of the **Conference Surplus
Reinvestment**, which was launched in FY19. The surplus reinvestment for
Year N of a conference is 25% of the Conference Net from Year N-2 and
25% of the Conference Net from Year N-3. A limitation of the program is
that it currently requires a significant administrative overhead.

SIGSOFT also continued the special projects program for projects that
benefit SIGSOFT members, future SIGSOFT members or members of the
software engineering community. An example of a special project was the
**Summer School on Modelling and Programming**, from January 19-24, 2020
in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The school had 45 students and 10
speakers and assistants to learn about several aspects of software
modeling: What is software modelling? How can we bridge the gap between
a model and the program? How are these tools and techniques used in
industry? The school was organized by Judith Bishop, Richard Paige,
Willem Visser, and Bruce Watson for running a wonderful school.
([www.ssmodpro.org](https://www.ssmodpro.org)). Another special project
was **SE Garage**, which goal is to provide a central archive of curated
tools developed in SE research
([www.segarage.org](https://www.segarage.org)).

SIGSOFT also appointed Andreas Zeller as the **Climate Change Liaison**,
who is in charge of increasing the sustainability of SIGSOFT conferences
and to coordinate with SIGSOFT conferences, ACM, and the other SIGs to
reduce the climate impact of our work.

Martin Robillard was appointed as **Research Highlights Chair** with the
charter to define a process to select SIGSOFT Research Highlights and to
increase the participation of SE papers in the Research Highlights
section from CACM.

The **Software Engineering Notes** have a new Editor, Dietmar Pfahl, who
has modernized the newsletter. SEN is now published on time with more
columns than before. The April 2020 issue was the last printed Software
Engineering Notes. Going forward the SEN newsletter will be distributed
exclusively in electronic form.

**INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS**

To encourage more volunteer participation, SIGSOFT launched several
strategic initiatives with an open call for volunteers in 2019. The
initiatives included Diversity, and Inclusion; Open Science; Data-driven
Introspection; Conference Operations; Paper and Review Quality; and many
more. Over the past year the initiatives made significant progress:

-   **Conference Operations** (led by Laura Moreno, Alexander
    Serebrenik): *Improve the experience for conference attendees*.
    Initially the team has run a survey to document how different
    conferences recognize most influential papers. The report is
    currently being finalized. In addition, they co-organized a session
    on Diversity and Inclusion at SE Conferences.
-   **Data-driven Introspection** (led by Tim Menzies, Bogdan
    Vasilescu): *Drive the understanding of the entire ecosystem of
    software engineering conferences*. The initiative is currently
    working on a SE community survey.
-   **Diversity and Inclusion** (led by Jo Atlee, Kelly Blincoe,
    Byron J. Williams): *Lead the efforts for increasing diversity,
    inclusion, and belonging*. Drafts have been created for codes of
    conduct and guidelines for conference EDI, accessible submissions
    and presentations, inclusive conference activities, inclusive review
    practices, inclusive session chairing practices. These documents are
    under review by the community and will be made available shortly.
    The initiative has also prepared a EDI climate survey, which will be
    sent to the community soon.
-   **Open Science** (led by Jonathan Bell, Daniel Graziotin): *Increase
    open science practices in the software engineering community*. Help
    the community to increase the accessibility, reproducibility, and
    replicability of our research outcomes. The initiative drafted a
    blueprint for generating open science policies and instructions for
    reviewers for research venues. The current draft is at:
    https://github.com/acmsigsoft/open-science-policies The initiative
    also has a working group on artifact evaluation. The latest
    discussion can be found here
    https://github.com/acmsigsoft/artifact-evaluation
-   **Paper and Review Quality** (led by Paul Ralph and Romain Robbes):
    *Increase the quality of our research papers and reviews, for
    example by developing guidelines on how to review certain types of
    papers. Make recommendations on how to improve review processes*.
    The task force has put together an initial draft of a Empirical
    Standards and Reviewer Field Manual that will be released soon for
    comments by the community.

The software engineering community has many community-driven vehicles to
promote open science such as dedicated tracks for replications and
negative results at conferences, the ROSE festival
<https://github.com/researchart/rose>, and pre-registered studies (e.g.,
MSR 2020, ICSME 2020 in partnership with the Empirical Software
Engineering journal).

**BROADENING PARTICIPATION**

Several events or programs were focused on broadened participation
either geographically, or among under-represented members of your
community and

-   The ICSE conferences continued the Student Mentoring Workshop aimed
    at advanced undergraduates and first/second year graduate students.
    The goal of the workshop is to attract students to research careers
    in software engineering, to demystify the graduate school
    experience, and to offer first-hand perspectives on graduate study
    from recent Ph.D. graduates, young scholars, and senior researchers.
-   Several SIGSOFT software engineering conferences (for example,
    ASE 2019) have started to appoint Diversity and Inclusion chairs to
    organize D&I activities at meetings. Improving the diversity and
    inclusiveness of the community that we serve is and always will be a
    priority.
-   To broaden, reach and membership, SIGSOFT has established national
    chapters in India (iSoft) and China (cSoft). Each chapter has a
    liaison on the SIGSOFT EC, in addition to our long-standing
    International Liaison. The ISSTA 2019 conference was held in China,
    the ESEM 2019 conference in Brazil, and the ICSE 2020 conference was
    scheduled to be in South Korea but unfortunately had to be moved to
    a virtual format. SIGSOFT also supported a summer school in South
    Africa.

**KEY ISSUES FACING SIGSOFT**

While SIGSOFT is stable and strong, there are several challenges we
continue to face.

-   Given the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unknown if and
    when physical conferences will restart and what format they will
    have. This makes planning more complicated and adds extra work and
    anxiety to the conference organizers. SIGSOFT will do its best to
    support all conferences formats going forward.
-   While virtual conferences have largely worked so far, thanks to
    heroic efforts by the organizers and other volunteers (e.g.,
    Jonathan Bell, Crista Lopes and Benjamin Pierce for the Clowdr tool,
    <https://www.clowdr.org/>), they come at a cost of missed social
    connections and a lack of feeling included, especially for newcomers
    to the SE community. Furthermore, hybrid conferences will only
    double the work it takes to organize a conference because in
    addition to a physical format a virtual format has to be supported.
-   Despite a large growth of software engineers, SIGSOFT's membership
    numbers have not been growing. We will aim to increase membership by
    providing more benefits to SIGSOFT members, increased visibility of
    SIGSOFT at conferences, and a focus on practitioners with the help
    of the industry liaison.
-   We continue to work to increase the global reach of SIGSOFT by
    continuing to establish long-term working relationships with our
    Indian, Chinese, and South American colleagues, as well as expanding
    the reach of SIGSOFT into Africa. Over the past few years, China has
    grown to the second most active country in software engineering
    research. We will work towards further growing the community and
    interest in SIGSOFT in these regions.
-   Several members of our community have raised concerns over the lack
    of gold open access offerings at SIGSOFT conferences. This may
    become a problem for researchers who are subject to the Plan S --
    Open Access Mandate. We are looking into how the changing open
    access landscape will affect SIGSOFT and how ACM's policies,
    practices, and initiatives can work for SIGSOFT members. To
    accelerate open access for SIGSOFT conferences we have appointed
    Arie van Deursen as Open Access Liaison.
