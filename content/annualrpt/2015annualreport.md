Barbara, advised by Professor Tevfik Bultan.

Many of our sponsored meetings this year also presented ACM SIGSOFT
Distinguished Paper Awards to the authors of a select number of their
accepted papers. The awardees are listed in next section.

SIGNIFICANT PAPERS ON NEW AREAS THAT WERE PUBLISHED IN PROCEEDINGS

The problems and topics addressed in the papers presented at SIGSOFT
meetings remain varied and timely. Software engineering researchers are
increasing their application of techniques borrowed from other areas of
computer science, particularly virtualization, mobile computing, and
human/computer interaction. The aceptance rates have been around the
20 - 25% range with SIGSOFT Distinguished paper awards ratio being up to
1 award for every 10 accepted papers. The Foundations of Software
Engineering (FSE 2014) was held November 16 - 21, 2014 in Hong Kong,
China. It had 272 submissions with 74 papers accepted (27%) resulting in
6 Distinguished Paper Awards. of which the following provided innovative

SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDED A SPRINGBOARD FOR FURTHER TECHNICAL
EFFORTS

SIGSOFT has two software engineering education programs - one targeted
toward students and the seconded focused on educators. Students receive
discounted membership rates and registration fees at all SIGSOFT -
sponsored conferences and workshops. In addition, our two flagship
conferences: ICSE and ESEC/FSE (as well as ISSTA) offer a Doctoral
Symposium where students are mentored by experienced Software
Engineering professors. Also, SIGSOFT provides travel support to SIGSOFT
sponsored or co-sponsored conferences or workshops for graduate and
undergraduate students who are SIGSOFT members through the Conference
Aid Program for Students (CAPS) - http://www.sigsoft.org/CAPS/.
Attendance at conferences and workshops to present papers and to
interact with researchers and practitioners in software engineering is
an important component of students\' education and professional
development. Moreover, students\' presence at conferences and workshops
enriches and broadens conference and workshop activities. Conferences
and workshops are also a good way to introduce students to the services
of SIGSOFT. In FY 2015 over \$705K of grants were given to 71 graduate
and 6 undergraduate students (out of 131 requests).

-   At ICSE 2015 we are able to fund 56 out of 59 applications.
-   16 from Europe
-   11 from Canada
-   19 from US
-   2 from Brazil
-   6 from Asia (China, Japan, India)
-   One from New Zealand and from Australia

SIGSOFT holds Software Engineering Educators Symposium (SEES) in non
ESEC/FSE years. It consists of two half - day tutorials covering
approaches for teaching programming and software engineering to
undergraduates. Symposium participants are provided access to
instructional materials, receive practical tips on how to successfully
apply the approaches, and learned about tools that support hands-on
instruction and active learning. ACM SIGSOFT provided funding for this
year\'s FSE in Hong Kong bringing together Asian software engineering
educators.

INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE SERVICE TO SOME PART OF THE TECHNICAL
COMMUNITY

To better serve the Software Engineering technical community, SIGSOFT
extended the resources it provides to it members by:

1.  Creating an Early Career Award that recognizes individuals whose
    last computer-related educational degree (i.e., baccalaureate,
    masters, or doctorate degree) was awarded no earlier than 7 years
    ago at the time of nomination.
2.  Funding the establishment of a CAPS Application Web Site to
    streamline the processing of applications. This included providing
    for room sharing options that could increase the effectiveness of
    CAPS student funding.
3.  Starting the SIGSOFT Webinar Series in June with three webinars that
    had over 1000 registerants. The webinars are archived and open to
    the general software engineering community. The webinars are based
    on the Future of Software Engineering Track at ICSE 2014 as well as
    recent keynote addresses and workshop summaries.
4.  Creating a web page (http://www.sigsoft.org/resources/opentoc.html)
    accessible through the SIGSOFT home page with the table of contents
    and ACM Authorizer links to over 80 ACM conferences. This provides
    free access to the proceeding\'s papers maintained in the ACM DL for
    a one year period from the conference start date.
5.  Funding the establishment of a series of Symposia in collaboration
    with local research communities and targeted at South American
    students and young researchers in order to have a record number of
    South American submissions, acceptances, and attendance to all ICSE
    2017 tracks. These events are organized in conjunction with, amongst
    others, CibSE - the Ibero-American Conference on Software
    Engineering, the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering, the
    Argentinian Symposium on Software Engineering, and the annual
    meeting of the Chilean Computer Society.

BROADENING PARTICIPATION EVENTS/PROGRAM

In order to increase participation in SIGSOFT-sponsored events and
increase/retain membership, we:

-   Offered free online student memberships to students attending
    FSE 2014. A total of 31 students took advantage of this offer
-   Established a SIGSOFT Chapter in India (iSoft) and created a liaison
    position on the SIGSOFT EC. In addition we offered free online
    access to the iSoft members to the SIGSOFT Newsletter and created a
    distribution list for its members to receive SIGSOFT announcements.
-   Added two \$10K projects to the 2015 budget to support yet to be
    determined projects.
-   Planned for the first SIGSOFT Town Hall meeting at ISSTA (Town Hall
    meetings previously had been held only at ICSE and ESEC/FSE)
-   Started laying the foundation for creating a SIGSOFT Chapter in
    China.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF KEY ISSUES FACING THE SIGSOFT MEMBERSHIP

Challenges for the years to come include:

-   Increasing the number of award nominations
-   Reducing conference/workshop registration fees
-   Providing more resources to practitioners
-   Increasing use of social media
-   Finding more Webinar Speakers and Topics.
-   Establishing a working relationship with Chinese and South American
    software engineering Researchers.
