## Submitted by Thomas Zimmermann, SIGSOFT Chair

*SIGSOFT seeks to improve our ability to engineer software by
stimulating interaction among practitioners, researchers, and educators;
by fostering the professional development of software engineers; and by
representing software engineers to professional, legal, and political
entities.*

ACM\'s SIGSOFT had another excellent year, both technically and
financially in 2018-2019. This report provides a summary of key SIGSOFT
activities over the past year.

**AWARDS GIVEN OUT**

The SIGSOFT awards program recognizes the many achievements of the
software engineering community. The awards, including our prestigious
service, research, and education awards, were presented again this year
at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2019) in
Montreal, Canada.

    Engineering (ESEC/FSE 2005).
-   The Impact Paper Award is in addition to the **Most Influential
    Paper Awards**, also known as \"test of time awards\", which are
    given to papers that have appeared at a particular conference. At
    ICSE the SIGSOFT co-sponsored conference with the longest track
    record of awarding Most Influential Papers, the award went to the
    ICSE 2009 paper \"Automatically finding patches using genetic
    programming\", by Westley Weimer, ThanhVu Nguyen, Claire Le Goues,
    Stephanie Forrest. The ESEC/FSE conference recognized two papers
    from FSE 2018: \"Latent Social Structure in Open Source Projects\",

    Paper Awards**. SIGSOFT allows up to 10% of the accepted papers to
    be selected for this award. The list of recognized papers is
    available at
    [here](/awards/distinguishedpaper).

**SIGNIFICANT PAPERS ON NEW AREAS**

Software is still eating the world. A unique aspect of software
engineering is that it branches into a range of different application
domains as well as other research areas in computer science, such as
human-computer interaction, mobile computing, artificial intelligence,
distributed systems, and more recently big data and machine learning,
and so on. This is because everything depends now on software. As
examples for the breath of the software engineering field, we highlight
below distinguished papers from the ESEC/FSE 2018 and ICSE 2019, two of
the main general software engineering conferences sponsored by SIGSOFT.
Some areas like testing, verification, and performance have and always
will be important. Building solutions at scale has also been important
for software engineering and this has only increased over the past
years. Today software can have hundred million of lines of code. In
addition to scale of the systems being built, the scale of research has
increased. Rather than studying a few projects, empirical research now
investigates hundreds if not thousands of projects, often at the level
of entire ecosystems. The community is also making progress is
leveraging biosensors such as fMRI and fNIRS to better understand
software developers. A trend over the past few years has been the
adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence in software.
This has led to research both on leveraging ML and AI to improve the way
software is being built (AI4SE), but also to research that incorporate
SE concepts into ML and AI processes and workflows (SE4AI). Being able
to understand ML and AI system and ensure their fairness and that they
behave responsible is one of the important challenges ahead.

**SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS**

Over the past several years, SIGSOFT has introduced several programs to
aid and expand our membership. Two signature programs are the Webinars
and the CAPS funding.

-   The SIGSOFT **Webinar series** remains very popular; in the past
    year, SIGSOFT organized 12 webinars on topics such as
    gender-inclusive software engineering, the role of programmers in
    the age of AI, intelligent software engineering, 50 years of
    software engineering, and successful expert software designers.
-   Through the **Conference Aid Program for Students (CAPS)**, we
    provide travel support to conferences for dozens of graduate and
    undergraduate student-members as well as support to defray the costs
    of childcare for all members of our community (faculty qualify as
    well). CAPS has been extended to help defray travel costs of a
    certain number of professional SIGSOFT members as well. The new
    program will launch this Fall.

**INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS**

Several new programs or efforts were launched at SIGSOFT in the past
year:

-   **Conference surplus reinvestment**. The past Executive Committee
    approved a surplus reinvestment program, which was implemented in
    FY19. The surplus reinvestment for Year N of a conference is 25% of
    the Conference Net from Year N-2 and 25% of the Conference Net from
    Year N-3.

-   **Special projects**. We launched a call for projects that benefit
    SIGSOFT members, future SIGSOFT members or members of the software
    engineering community.

-   **SIGSOFT Initiatives**. To encourage more volunteer participation,
    we launched several strategic initiatives with an open call for
    volunteers. The initiatives included Diversity, and Inclusion; Open
    Science; Data-driven Introspection; Conference Operations; Paper and
    Review Quality; and many more. The goal was to provide the community
    with a platform for topics they feel passionate about. The response
    was immense: 123 people volunteered. The initiatives are:
    -   Conference Operations (led by Laura Moreno, Alexander
        Serebrenik): Improve the experience for conference attendees.
    -   Data-driven Introspection (led by Tim Menzies, Bogdan
        Vasilescu): Drive the understanding of the entire ecosystem of
        software engineering conferences.
    -   Diversity and Inclusion (led by Jo Atlee, Kelly Blincoe,
        Byron J. Williams): Lead the efforts for increasing diversity,
        inclusion, and belonging.
    -   Open Science (led by Jonathan Bell, Daniel Graziotin): Increase
        open science practices in the software engineering community.
        Help the community to increase the accessibility,
        reproducibility, and replicability of our research outcomes.
    -   Paper and Review Quality (led by Paul Ralph and Romain Robbes):
        Increase the quality of our research papers and reviews, for
        example by developing guidelines on how to review certain types
        of papers. Make recommendations on how to improve review
        processes.

-   **PC Member Nominations**. After a successful pilot at ASE 2019, we
    launched an open call for reviewers for the top three
    software-engineering conferences co-sponsored by SIGSOFT. Members of
    the community could nominate themselves or a colleague for the
    program committees of ASE 2020, ESEC/FSE 2021, and ICSE 2021.

-   **Open Science**. Many SIGSOFT sponsored conferences pushed heavily
    on open science and appointed dedicated chairs to help authors
    increase the openness of the research. A great resource on open
    science in double blind review settings is by Daniel Graziotin.

-   **New SIGSOFT logo**. We also announced a new logo. The logo is
    composed of two tuning forks. The logo will be rolled out throughout
    the rest of the year.

**BROADENING PARTICIPATION**

Several events or programs were focused on broadened participation
either geographically, or among under-represented members of your
community and

-   The ICSE 2019 Student Mentoring Workshop was aimed at advanced
    undergraduates and first/second year graduate students. e goal of
    the workshop is to attract students to research careers in software
    engineering, to de-mystify the graduate school experience, and to
    offer first-hand perspectives on graduate study from recent Ph.D.
    graduates, young scholars, and senior researchers. The workshop was
    inspired by similar workshops organized by SIGPLAN. The goal for
    SIGSOFT to increase the number of student programs over the coming
    years.
-   Diversity and Inclusion Chairs at Conferences. Several software
    engineering conferences (for example, ASE 2019) have started to
    appoint diversity and inclusion chairs to organize D&I activities at
    meetings. At SIGSOFT level, we appointed three chairs to lead the
    SIGSOFT wide diversity and inclusion efforts. Improving the
    diversity of the community that we serve is a priority.
-   To broaden, reach and membership, SIGSOFT has established national
    chapters in India (iSoft) and China (cSoft). Each chapter has a
    liaison on the SIGSOFT EC, in addition to our long-standing
    International Liaison. The ICPE 2019 conference was held in Mumbai
    India. ISSTA 2019 was held in Beijing, China.

**KEY ISSUES FACING SIGSOFT**

While SIGSOFT is stable and strong, there are several challenges we
continue to face:

-   Despite a large growth of software engineers, SIGSOFT\'s membership
    numbers have not been growing. We will aim increase membership by
    providing more benefits to SIGSOFT members, increased visibility of
    SIGSOFT at conferences, and a focus on practitioners with the help
    of the industry liaison. We are also working on engaging SIGSOFT
    members more.
-   We will also work to increase the global reach of SIGSOFT by
    continuing to establish long-term working relationship with our
    Indian, Chinese, and South American colleagues, as well as expanding
    the reach of SIGSOFT into Africa. Over the past few years, China has
    grown to the second most active country in software engineering
    research. We will work towards further growing the community and
    interest in SIGSOFT in these regions.
-   The conference registration fees have been rising. While SIGSOFT
    provides travel support with the CAPS program and recently adopted a
    model to return conference surpluses to future editions of the same
    conference, this will likely not be enough to keep the registration
    fees affordable. In addition to registration is a major cost factor
    for attendees. Inspired by the success of the webinars, we will
    explore to what extent virtual conferences can provide similar
    benefits as physical conferences at lower cost.
-   Several members of our community have raised concerns over the lack
    of gold open access offerings at SIGSOFT conferences. This may
    become a problem for researchers who are subject to the Plan S -
    Open Access Mandate. We are looking into how the changing open
    access landscape will affect SIGSOFT and how ACM\'s policies,
    practices, and initiatives can work for SIGSOFT members.
