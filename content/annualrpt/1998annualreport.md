# SIGSOFT Annual Report

## July, 1997 - June, 1998

## Submitted by: David Notkin, SIGSOFT Chair

SIGSOFT has had an excellent year, the first with a new set of officers.

On the awards front, we continued to make our annual service and
research awards. This year\'s ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service award
was presented to Bruce Barnes, who was largely responsible for putting
an effective software engineering research program into place at NSF.
This year\'s ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research award was presented to
David Parnas, for his many contributions to the area of software design.
Joint with IEEE TCSE, we also continued to award the Most Influential
Paper from ICSE-10, which this year went to the ICSE-10 paper *\"On
Modeling and Analyzing System Behavior: Myths, Facts and Challenges\"*,
authored by David Harel and colleagues. We made several awards to
students for travel support to SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences, under our
CAPS program. Several of the new ACM Fellows are members of SIGSOFT, a
fact that is very rewarding. As a final note, several years ago the
SIGSOFT Executive Committee agreed to have Program Committees name up to
10% of the papers from conferences as Distinguished Papers; we have,
however, never put this decision into action. We plan to do so this
year, also understanding that we need to clear this through the ACM
awards committee.

We have been involved this year in a number of significant and
innovative programs.

-   We have agreed, with the support of ACM HQ, to continue to take a
    leadership role in issues surrounding software engineering as a
    profession. By cementing decisions and participation in the past, we
    are ensuring that we will be co-equals in this effort with the IEEE
    Computer Society. Specifically, we have agreed to continue our
    participation in the curricular committees related to software
    engineering professionalism (at-large SIGSOFT members Tony Wasserman
    and Martin Griss are serving on this committee) and on the Body of
    Knowledge effort (Michal Young has agreed to serve on this
    committee). In addition, we have committed up to \$65K in SIGSOFT
    funds, to be at least matched by ACM HQ funding, to support this
    effort over the next several years.
-   At our request, ACM has revised its policy about SIGs being
    in-cooperation with commercial ventures. This is now permitted,
    which is clearly in the interest of SIG members.
-   Our major conferences (Foundations of Software Engineering, the
    International Conference on Software Testing and Analysis, and the
    International Conference on Software Engineering) continue to be
    strong. (See some comments on ICSE near the end of the report.)
-   To work to (re)strengthen our ties with SIGPLAN, we were
    in-cooperation with the new PASTE workshop Program Analysis for
    Software Tools and Engineering. To strength them even further, we
    will co-sponsor the next PASTE, which will be held collocated with
    the ACM SIGSOFT 2000 Symposium on the Foundations of Software
    Engineering (which itself is joint with the European Software
    Engineering Conference).
-   SIGSOFT, along with three other SIGs (CHI, GROUP, and MOD), is
    co-sponsoring WACC \'99, the International Joint Conference on Work
    Activities and Coordination and Collaboration.
-   Will Tracz, with a growing cadre of volunteers, has continued to
    make our newsletter, *SEN*, stronger and stronger. Among the
    specific improvements this year are: a web-based questionnaire about
    *SEN* to help us gain feedback (from *SEN* subscribers as well as
    those who don\'t subscribe) about how to improve *SEN* (we\'re now
    gathering the results); a new, on-going column containing interviews
    with SIGSOFT members who are ACM Fellows, where our intent is to
    recognize and promote role models; a semi-improved web site for
    *SEN*; and our largest total page count in history (1224 pages,
    including proceedings).

There are several other key issues that SIGSOFT is aggressively
addressing.

-   We need to continue to increase interactions with other SIGs; PASTE
    and WACC are two examples of this, but we need to press this model
    further.
-   We need to work to reduce overlapping conferences and workshops; the
    problem here, of course, is that when there are multiple events that
    have very similar agendas, the quality suffers and confusion among
    the membership increases. In addition, a cluttered calendar makes it
    more difficult for us to develop new events over time.

One example of an existing, unfortunate overlap is SIGSOFT\'s Symposium
on Software Reuse (SSR) and IEEE CS\'s International Conference on
Software Reuse (ICSR). Will Tracz (who is involved in both conferences)
and I pushed hard to merge these conferences; although initially agreed
upon by ICSR, they later backed off when we asserted that the steering
committee for the new, merged conference should also change.

-   We need to fix our relationship with IEEE CS, in particular IEEE
    TCSE (Technical Committee on Software Engineering). The ICSR example
    is one example, but our joint sponsorship of ICSE (International
    Conference on Software Engineering) is an increasingly bad
    situation. This is due to bad will between SIGSOFT and TCSE, and
    because of the difficulties that volunteers face in dealing with two
    societies: two TMRFs, with different rules, different financial
    policies, a multitude of people to deal with, and fundamentally
    different philosophies and goals. Ideally, we could negotiate a
    situation in which IEEE CS would give up its sponsorship of ICSE;
    another possibility would be for SIGSOFT to become a \"managing
    partner\" for the conference.

There is one more crucial issue facing SIGSOFT (in this specific regard,
SIGSOFT is a clear microcosm of ACM). We claim that we are a
professional society geared towards the needs of researchers,
practitioners, and educators. We do an adequate job for educators, and a
good job for researchers. But it\'s clear that we are not doing a
satisfactory job with respect to the needs of practitioners. (Our
strongest voice in industry is to industrial researchers, not active
practitioners.) This is because SIGSOFT (and ACM in general) has not
made clear to itself (to say nothing of to the membership and potential
membership) what we can and should provide to them. Our involvement in
software engineering as a profession issues is a great example of a
plus, but we need a clearer overall vision. Without this, SIGSOFT
membership will at best be stable and will more likely continue to
decline slowly but surely.
