## Submitted by Nenad Medvidovic, SIGSOFT Chair

*SIGSOFT seeks to improve our ability to engineer software by
stimulating interaction among practitioners, researchers, and educators;
by fostering the professional development of software engineers; and by
representing software engineers to professional, legal, and political
entities.*

ACM\'s SIGSOFT had another excellent year, both technically and
financially in 2017-2018. This report provides a summary of key SIGSOFT
activities over the past year.

AWARDS GIVEN OUT

SIGSOFT\'s awards program recognizes the many achievements of the
software engineering community (see http://www.sigsoft.org/ for the most
recent awardees). A number of the awards, including our prestigious
service, research, and education awards, were presented again this year
at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2018) in
Gothenburg, Sweden.

-   The ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award was presented to Andreas
    Zeller from Saarland University, Germany, \"for outstanding seminal
    contributions in automated debugging and mining software
    repositories.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award was presented to Shriram
    Krishnamurthy from Brown University, USA, \"for his contributions to
    the advancement of the research and practice of software
    engineering.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award was presented to David
    Rosenblum from the National University of Singapore, \"for
    outstanding leadership and service to the software engineering
    research community and to broadening participation in computing.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Early Career Research Award was presented to
    Gabriele Bavota from University of Lugano, Switzerland, \"for
    outstanding contributions in the area of software engineering as an
    early career investigator.\"
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award was given to
    Fan Long, for his Ph.D. dissertation titled \"Automatic Patch
    Generation via Learning from Successful Human Patches.\" The
    dissertation was completed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
    USC, under the guidance of Professor Martin Rinard.
-   We recognized the new ACM Senior Members, Distinguished Members, and
    Fellows from the SIGSOFT community. In particular, the new
    Distinguished Members are Myra Cohen, James Cross, Mauro Pezzè,
    Hridesh Rajan, Willem Visser, and Thomas Zimmermann. The new ACM
    Fellows are Margaret Burnett and Gail Murphy.
-   The ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award recognizes a paper published in a
    SIGSOFT conference at least 10 years earlier that has had
    exceptional impact on research or practice. This year, the award
    went to the paper \"DECKARD: Scalable and Accurate Tree-Based
    Detection of Code Clones\" by Lingxiao Jiang, Ghassan Misherghi,
    Zhendong Su, and Stephane Glondu, published in Proceedings of the
    29th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2007).
-   The Impact Paper Award is in addition to the Most Influential Paper
    Awards, also known as \"test of time awards\", which are given to
    papers that have appeared at a particular conference. ICSE is the
    SIGSOFT co-sponsored conference with the longest track record of
    awarding Most Influential Papers. This year, the award went to the
    ICSE 2008 paper \"Debugging Reinvented: Asking and Answering Why and
    Why Not Questions About Program Behavior\", by Andy J. Ko and
    Brad A. Myers.
-   Many of SIGSOFT\'s sponsored meetings this year also presented
    Distinguished Paper Awards. SIGSOFT allows up to 10% of the accepted
    papers to be selected for this award. The list of awarded papers is
    maintained on SIGSOFT website\'s Awards page. As an example, the
    papers that received the award at ICSE 2018 in Gothenburg, Sweden
    are:
    -   \"Spatio-Temporal Context Reduction: A Pointer-Analysis- Based

SIGNIFICANT PAPERS ON NEW AREAS

Software engineering has traditionally been an interdisciplinary area,
branching into a range of different application domains as well as other
research areas in computer science, such as human-computer interaction,
mobile computing, artificial intelligence, distributed systems, more
recently big data and machine learning, and so on. This is because every
facet of computing, as well as many other scientific and engineering
disciplines, depend on software. Advances in these other areas mentioned
above - from big data, to the cloud, virtualization, deep learning,
mobile computing, formal methods, computer security, etc., with
applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, medicine, and countless
other areas - require corresponding software engineering methods, tools,
and techniques. This is reflected in the types of papers that
increasingly appear in software engineering venues sponsored by SIGSOFT.
Such papers tend to combine advances in multiple areas into solutions to
specific problems. As examples, we highlight two such papers, the first
a recipient of the SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the Joint
European Sofwtare Engineering Conference and Symposium on the
Foundations of Software Engineering, held in September 2017 in
Paderborn, Germany (ESEC/FSE 2017), and the second a recipient of the
same award at the International Conference on Software Engineering, held
in May 2018 in Gothenburg, Sweden (ICSE 2018):

-   \"Cooperative Kernels: GPU Multitasking for Blocking Algorithms\",
    by Tyler Sorensen, Hugues Evrard, and Alastair F. Donaldson
    presented a technique that extends the traditional GPU programming
    model geared towards writing blocking algorithms, where workgroups
    of a cooperative kernel are fairly scheduled, and multitasking is
    supported via a small set of language extensions through which the
    kernel and scheduler cooperate.
-   \"Identifying Design Problems in the Source Code: A Grounded
    Theory\", by Leonardo De Silva Sousa, Anderson Oliviera, Willian
    Oizumi, Simone Barbosa, Alessandro Garcia, Jaejoon Lee, Marcos
    Kalinowski, Rafael de Mello, Roberto Oliveira, Neto Baldoino and
    Rodrigo Paes described a multi-trial industrial experiment with
    professionals from five software companies to build a grounded
    theory that offers explanations on how software developers identify
    design problems in practice. This work revealed specific
    characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful, and
    that developers often combine different types of symptoms to
    identify a single design problem.

We have decided to highlight these two papers as a way of demonstrating
the breadth of topics that are commonly covered in SIGSOFT-sponsored
conferences today.

INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS

Over the past several years, SIGSOFT has introduced a number of programs
to aid and expand our membership. Some representative examples are as
follows. Our student-members receive discounted membership rates and
significantly discounted registration fees at all SIGSOFT-sponsored
conferences. Most of our conferences offer Doctoral Symposia where
students are mentored by experienced Software Engineering professors.
The SIGSOFT Webinar series remains very popular; in the past year,
SIGSOFT organized 11 webinars with a total of 9,970 registrants and
4,725 attendees, of which 2,367 viewed the webinars live. We recently
introduced the Early Career Award that recognizes individuals at early
stages in their careers. Even though the Early Career Award is quite
young, it has clearly become a popular and respected award. SIGSOFT
provides travel support to conferences for dozens of graduate and
undergraduate student-members as well as support to defray the costs of
childcare for all members of our community (faculty qualify as well),
through the Conference Aid Program for Students (CAPS); as of the past
year, CAPS has been extended to help defray travel costs of a certain
number of post-doctoral researchers.

To broaden SIGSOFT\'s reach and membership, SIGSOFT has established
national chapters in India (ISoft) and China (CSoft). Each chapter has a
liaison on the SIGSOFT EC, in addition to our long-standing
International Liaison. As part of the support for these two communities
specifically, SIGSOFT sponsors travel for a total of four SIGSOFT
Distinguished Paper Award winning authors to present their work at
ISoft\'s and CSoft\'s flagship national events (two at each event). The
success of this program is reflected in the decision by the organizers
of ISEC 2017, ISoft\'s premier event, to fund the attendance and
presentation of additional SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award winners.
Furthermore, SIGSOFT has sponsored travel for two speakers at each of
the three annual Warm-up Workshops organized to expose the Latin
American software engineering community to ICSE, which was held in
Buenos Aires in 2017. SIGSOFT has been in discussions with the
organizers of ICSE 2017 to sponsor a post-mortem event for the Latin
American software engineering community.

KEY ISSUES FACING SIGSOFT

While SIGSOFT is stable and strong, there are several challenges we
continue to face:

-   SIGSOFT\'s membership numbers have been stable despite a large
    growth of software engineering worldwide. We will aim to address
    this, with a particular focus on practitioners. To this end, we
    already have a couple of programs in place, but we will need to
    better utilize SIGSOFT\'s Industry Liaison.
-   We will continue to work on establishing a long-term working
    relationship with our Indian, Chinese, and South American
    colleagues, as well as expanding the reach of SIGSOFT into Africa.
    We are currently in discussions with out South Korean colleagues
    about devising a way of including them more integrally in SIGSOFT\'s
    activities, especially in light of the fact that ICSE 2020 will be
    held in Seoul. While we have had some successes in each of these
    geographic areas, there is significant room for further growth.
-   The typical conference registration fees place a significant burden
    on the research funds of many members of our community. SIGSOFT has
    tried to alleviate this burden through the CAPS program. We will
    work on developing ways of reducing the fees more directly. SIGSOFT
    has recently adopted a model to return conference surpluses to
    future editions of the same conference, in a way that will directly
    apply to reduced registration fees.
-   We recognize that traditional ways of reaching our membership are no
    longer sufficient. To address that, we will work on increasing
    SIGSOFT\'s presence on social media. In addition to the elected
    SIGSOFT Executive Committee Member-at-Large who serves in the role
    of Social Media Chair, we have recently appointed a Deputy Social
    Media Chair in order to increase and improve our presence in this
    area.
