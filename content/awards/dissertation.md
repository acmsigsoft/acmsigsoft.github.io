The SIGSOFT Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award is presented annually to the authors of outstanding doctoral dissertations in the area of Software Engineering. The author of winning dissertation(s) will be invited to publish a dissertation summary in the SIGSOFT newsletter, Software Engineering Notes (SEN). 

The award is for an outstanding dissertation (in software engineering) dated within the year preceding the nomination due date. For nominations for the October 20, 2025, deadline, dissertations dated November, 2024 to November, 2025 are eligible. The dissertation date can refer to the “deposit date,” “committee approval date,” or another reasonable and relevant date, depending on the process followed by the nominee’s institution. However, please note that a dissertation can be nominated only once. Thus, if, e.g., the “deposit date” and “committee approval date” would fall into two award periods, the thesis cannot be nominated twice, and the nomination must choose one period. Especially given the time-specificity of this award, note that the selection committee is able to recognize multiple outstanding dissertations in a year, if circumstances warrant. 

Consult the [main SIGSOFT Awards page](/awards/sigsoftawards/) for key
dates, general nomination and eligibility instructions, and a link to the submission
portal. 
Nominee affiliations should specify both the degree-granting institution,
and the nominee's current affiliation, if different. In _addition_ to the other
nomination package requirements listed on the main awards page, the single
nomination package PDF should _also_ include:
  1. The student's advisor(s)
  2. One- to two-page summary of the nominee's dissertation (in English)
  3. List of nominee's publications (that were used as the basis of chapters in the nominated dissertation)
