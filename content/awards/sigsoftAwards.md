# ACM SIGSOFT Awards

ACM SIGSOFT recognizes excellence in software engineering through several
awards, presented annually. These awards honor outstanding contributions to our
field, throughout our colleagues' careers. Awards are typically presented to
individuals, but can be awarded jointly when circumstances warrant, such as for
joint contributions.  

## Award Categories

### Senior Awards
- **[Distinguished Service
Award](https://www2.sigsoft.org/awards/distinguishedservice/)** - Recognizes
dedicated and important service to the software engineering community 
- **[Outstanding Research Award](https://www2.sigsoft.org/awards/outstandingresearch/)** - Honors
significant and lasting research contributions to the theory or practice of
software engineering
- **[Influential Educator Award](https://www2.sigsoft.org/awards/influentialeducator/)** - Celebrates
significant contributions and impact on software engineering education as a
teacher, mentor, researcher, author, and/or policy maker

### Junior Awards
- **[Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www2.sigsoft.org/awards/dissertation/)** - Presented to the author of an outstanding doctoral dissertation in software engineering
- **[Early Career Researcher Award](https://www2.sigsoft.org/awards/earlycareerresearcher/)** - Recognizes outstanding contributions by early career investigators
- **[Frank Anger Memorial Award](https://www2.sigsoft.org/awards/anger/)** - Student travel award promoting cross-disciplinary research between SIGSOFT and SIGBED communities

### Impact Award

## Nomination Process

All awards follow a similar nomination process, with two key deadlines:

### Important Dates for 2025
- **Intent to Nominate Deadline: October 6, 2025** (First Monday in October)
- **Full Nomination Package Deadline: October 20, 2025** (Two weeks after intent deadline)

### How to Nominate
1. Submit an **intent to nominate** through the [awards nomination portal](https://sigsoft-awards.hotcrp.com/) by the first deadline
   - This is lightweight, requiring only basic information about the nominee(s)
   and nominator
   - Intentions to nominate must be received by the deadline for a candidate to
   be considered in the current award year. 
2. Submit the complete nomination package as a single PDF by the second deadline

Nominators of candidates who are not selected in a given award year will be
given the option to reuse nomination materials unmodified for up to two
consecutive additional years.

### Shared Nomination Requirements and eligibility

All nomination packages should include:
- Full name(s) and affiliation(s) of nominee(s)
- Proposed citation (up to 25 words)
- Succinct description of qualifications (100-250 words)
- Detailed nomination statement
- Up to three support letters (200-300 words each)
- **Important**: Each support letter must include: *"To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM's Core Values."*


#### Eligibility 

- Self nominations are permitted.
- The same individual cannot be nominated for different SIGSOFT awards in the
  same year.  However, the committee reserves the right to consider an
  individual for a different award than the one for which they are nominated, if
  they deem it more suitable.
- In general, SIGSOFT will not select individuals recognized  by an award from
  another professional society to receive an equivalent or 
  substantially similar SIGSOFT award.  Nominations of such individuals are
  permitted, but must include a clear justification for the nomination that articulates
  and justifies the special circumstances that motivate considering the nominee
  for such a substantially similar award.  

*Note: Certain awards have additional requirements and eligibility
 restrictions. Consult individual award pages for complete details.*


## Award Benefits

Awards are presented to recipients at plenary sessions of major conferences
(typically ICSE).  Recipients typically receive a stipend for travel support to
receive that award, along with an honorarium and a commemorative plaque.
Consult individual awards pages for complete details. 

## Selection Process

Each award has a dedicated selection committee that evaluates nominations based
on specific criteria. Committees have the option to decline making an award if
no suitable nominations are received.
