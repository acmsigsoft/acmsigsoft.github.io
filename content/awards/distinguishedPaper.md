## ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award

ACM SIGSOFT encourages SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences to designate a number of accepted papers for ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards for the conference. In addition to presenting certificates to the authors of awarded papers, two awarded papers from each ICSE, ESEC/FSE may be invited for presentation at the following Innovations in Software Engineering Conference (ISEC), which is sponsored by [SIGSE](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sigcse/), the Special Interest Group on Software Engineering of the Computer Society of India (CSI).

Papers accepted by the following conference may be awarded for ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards:
- ICSE
- FSE
- ASE
- ISSTA
- MODELS
- MSR
- ICPC
- ESEM
- FORGE
- Internetware
- Aiware

## Rules

### Number of ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Papers

In cases where the number of accepted papers is less than or equal to ten, one paper can be designated; in cases where the number of accepted papers is 11 through 20 inclusive, two papers can be designated; otherwise, 10% of the papers can be designated.

### Selecting ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Papers

ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards are to be awarded only for full-length technical papers accepted by the program committee for the main track of a SIGSOFT-sponsored meeting. They are not intended for abstracts or short papers, for papers from satellite or co-located events such as workshops and doctoral symposia, or for demo papers, panel summaries, invited papers and other such supplementary contributions.

### Notifying Recipients of ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Papers

Conference organizers can also decide how they want to notify the recipients of the Distinguished Paper awards. One possibility is to postpone the announcement of the award until an awards ceremony at the conference. Another possibility is to place the Distinguished Papers in strategic locations in the program -- for example, the first (or last) paper(s) in the program.

### How to Prepare ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Papers Award Certificates

The conference organizers prepare the certificates. Contact J.C. Peeples (peeples at hq.acm.org) to get a template you may use to create certificates. Please inform chair\_sigsoft (at) acm (dot) org of the award winners, so that they can be added to this page.

If the TMRF indicated that a best paper award would be given, the organizers will receive an email from [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) after the conference, asking for further details. Please respond to this email as well, so that the award winners will be listed in the ACM digital library.
