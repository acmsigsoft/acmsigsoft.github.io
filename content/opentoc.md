Open Table of Contents (TOC) Resources
======================================

The ACM OpenTOC is a unique service that enables Special Interest Groups to open the content from recently held conferences enabling visitors to download the definitive version of the contents from the ACM Digital Library at no charge for a one year period starting from the conference start date. Downloads of these articles are captured in official ACM statistics, improving the accuracy of usage and impact measurements. Links to the conference table of contents available to SIGSOFT members are below.
