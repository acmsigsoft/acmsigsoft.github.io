Guidelines for Running a SIGSOFT-Sponsored Workshop
===================================================

SIGSOFT encourages and sponsors workshops in all areas related to software engineering. The general benefits of and requirements for SIGSOFT [sponsorship](/policies/sponsorship) are the same as for conferences. In comparison to a conference, however, a workshop is a technical meeting that:

*   reports on work in progress,
*   has a narrow focus,
*   has sessions that enable interaction among workshop attendees, and
*   is relatively low cost.

SIGSOFT especially encourages workshops that collocate with SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences. One advantage of collocation is that the budgeting process is fairly simple, usually amounting to a one-page budget that can be handled using email.

To apply for sponsorship of a workshop, follow the [sponsorship guidelines](/policies/sponsorship).

SIGSOFT workshops usually result in a "succeedings", which is written sometime soon after the event and which serves as a public record of the discussions held at the workshop. The workshop succeedings usually are suitable for publication in [SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes](/SEN/SEN). If you wish to publish the succeedings in SEN, please contact the [SEN editor](/contact) at least six months in advance. Here is an [example succeedings](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=251844) that was published in SEN.
