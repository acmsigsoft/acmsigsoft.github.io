SIGSOFT Guidelines for Obtaining Cooperation Status
===================================================

SIGSOFT has two types of relationships with conferences and workshops:

*   [sponsorship](/policies/sponsorship) and
*   cooperation.

The primary difference between the two is that sponsorship implies financial risk and responsibility on the part of SIGSOFT, while cooperation implies none. The following description of the in-cooperation relationship details SIGSOFT's responsibilities, the meeting's responsibilities and directions for applying for in-cooperation status.

In-cooperation Status
---------------------

The requirements for SIGSOFT in-cooperation status include the following:

*   The meeting must have an open call for participation and a clearly documented evaluation and review process.
*   The meeting cannot be sponsored by a for-profit organization, although corporate support is allowed.
*   Registration costs should be reasonable and SIGSOFT members should get a lower registration rate.
*   For a new meeting, topics should be differentiable from topics of existing meetings.
*   The timing of the meeting should not be too close to other, already scheduled, SIGSOFT-sponsored meetings.
*   In the case of regional meetings serving a local community of software engineering researchers and practitioners, the requirements for differentiation in topics and timing may be relaxed.

Under in-cooperation, SIGSOFT is not financially responsible for the meeting.

SIGSOFT encourages in-cooperation conferences and workshops to follow SIGSOFT policies and procedures, including the following:

*   [SIGSOFT Policy on Program Committees](/policies/PCpolicy.html)
*   [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions)

In-cooperation provides a number of **benefits**:

*   You can use the ACM SIGSOFT name on publicity about the meeting
*   You can advertise your event at no cost in SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes (SEN). A single full-page advertisement that conforms to SEN publication guidelines should be sent to the editor of SEN at least six weeks before it is to appear
*   Your event will appear in the SIGSOFT [list of events](/event)
*   Your event will be entered into the Call for Papers and Professional Calendar sections of Communications of the ACM ([CACM](http://www.acm.org/cacm/)) and the ACM [conference calendar](http://campus.acm.org/calendar/) web site
*   A special rate is available for purchase of an advertisement in Communications of the ACM ([CACM](http://www.acm.org/cacm/)). Discounts on ACM mailing lists are also available. Please contact the SIGSOFT [Program Director](/contact/) for further information.
*   Conference papers are eligible to appear in the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/).
*   SEN will reserve space for a final report summarizing the meeting
*   You can obtain professional help and guidance from SIGSOFT and ACM Headquarters in organizing the event, including negotiations with hotels. (For more information, start [here](/event).)
*   You can obtain advice and guidance from the SIGSOFT Executive Committee, if solicited, in organizing and promoting your event

Conference organizers should contact SIGSOFT [Program Director](/contact/) at ACM Headquarters to have SIGSOFT membership materials sent directly to the conference location for display at the conference.

To **apply** for in-cooperation status please fill out and submit the [ACM In-Cooperation TMRF form](http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/incoop). The steps required to obtain in-cooperation status, along with application evaluation criteria, necessary forms and other relevant information are all found [here](http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/incoop). Additional guidelines on cooperation status can be found [here](http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/1-3incop).

A response to the request is usually given in 3 weeks.
