About SIGSOFT
=============

SIGSOFT focuses on issues related to all aspects of software development and maintenance. Areas of special interest include: requirements, specification and design, software architecture, validation, verification, debugging, software safety, software processes, software management, measurement, user interfaces, configuration management, software engineering environments, and CASE tools.

SIGSOFT has sponsors or co-sponsors many [conferences and events](/activities/overview/), and publishes [_Software Engineering Notes_](/SEN/SEN), a quarterly newsletter.

History
-------

The field of software engineering is generally considered to have begun with the [1968](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF) and [1969](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1969.PDF) NATO Software Engineering Conferences.

SIGSOFT was officially formed in 1976 as the Special Interest Committee on Software Engineering (SICSOFT), and converted to SIGSOFT in 1977. More details about the history of SIGSOFT, its officers, conferences, awards and more is available on the [SIGSOFT History Wiki](http://historywiki.acm.org/sigs/SIGSOFT).
