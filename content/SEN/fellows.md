### ACM Fellows Profiles

Each year, ACM recognizes members of the computing community who have made notable contributions to our field by honoring them as ACM Fellows. A large number of Fellows are also members of SIGSOFT, so beginning with the July 1998 issue of **Software Engineering Notes** (**SEN**), we've been publishing profiles of these folks. 
Here are the profiles published to date, along with the issue of SEN in which they appeared.
