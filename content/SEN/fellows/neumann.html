<p><em>Peter G. Neumann is Principal Scientist at SRI International's
Computer Science Laboratory.
He's concerned with computer systems and networks, trustworthiness
and dependability, high assurance, security, reliability, survivability,
safety, and many risks-related issues such as voting-system integrity,
crypto policy, social implications and human needs including privacy.</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Neumann created ACM SIGSOFT's </em>Software Engineering Notes
(SEN)<em> in 1976 and was its editor for 19 years.
He is known to many as the moderator of the ACM Risks Forum;
he also edits </em>Communications of the ACM's<em> Inside Risks
column, and chairs the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy and the
<a href="http://www.votingintegrity.org/">National Committee for Voting
Integrity</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>Neumann has participated in four studies for the
National Academies of Science. He's a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and AAAS, is
an SRI Fellow, co-founded People For Internet Responsibility
(<a href="http://www.PFIR.org/">PFIR</a>), and has taught courses at Darmstadt,
Stanford, U.C. Berkeley, and the University of Maryland.</em></p>

<p><em>Neumann was interviewed for this profile by Robert P. Schaefer in
March, 2007.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Q: Could you elaborate on the work that led up to your achieving
the distinction of ACM Fellow?</strong></em></p>

<p>Neumann: The citation was "in recognition of outstanding technical and
professional achievements in the field of information technology."  This was
in 1994, the first year of the Fellows program, in which 133 ACM Fellows were
selected. I presume the committee could not afford to spend a lot of time on
carefully crafted statements for each of us, and chose a rather inclusive
generic statement for me.  I had already been active in computer R&amp;D
since 1953, an ACM member since 1956, involved in SIGSOFT since its creation
in 1976, and creator of the ACM Risks Forum in 1985.  Perhaps different
activities appealed to different selectors.</p>

<p><em><strong>Who, and what events have been the greatest influences on your
life and work?</strong></em></p>

<p>My website,
<a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann">http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann</a>,
enumerates many inspirational colleagues and mentors, and a wonderful lengthy
1952 discussion with Albert Einstein on complexity that in several ways
stimulated my subsequent research.  My eight years at Harvard, two years on a
Fulbright in Germany, and ten years at Bell Labs in Murray Hill were clearly
all very formative, especially the five Multics years at Bell Labs (working
with Ken Thompson, Doug McIlroy, and Bob Morris, among others) and MIT
(F.J. Corbat&oacute;), Ted Glaser, Jerry Saltzer, and Bob Daley).  My
colleagues in the SRI Computer Science Lab (since 1971) have been wonderful
as well.  In addition, the RISKS-related efforts have clearly helped motivate
my research.</p>

<p><em><strong>You've been a contributor to all 32 volumes of </em>SEN<em>.
That's quite an accomplishment.  Can you give us your thoughts on the
value of </em>SEN<em> for the typical reader?</strong></em></p>

<p>I'm not sure there is a "typical" reader, or if there ever was one.
<em>SEN</em> has always sought to reach a rather diverse audience, crossing
boundaries among different disciplines.  Now that current and back
issues are increasingly online (thanks to Will Tracz), that audience can
expand even further.  I think <em>SEN</em>'s informality, relatively short
publication fuse, works in progress, practical sense, and good editorship all
contribute to its usefulness.
  
<p><em><strong>You are the editor of the ACM Risks Forum
(<a href="http://risks.org">http://www.risks.org</a> and
<a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks</a>),
author of the book </em>Computer-Related Risks<em>, and have documented
many relevant risks over the years.  What is your all-time favorite
Computer-Related Risk?</strong></em></p>

<p>That's a tough call, because the space is so multidimensional.  There is
no one favorite that stands out.  What is most relevant is perhaps that the
same kinds of failures and risks keep recurring.  From a pedagogic point
of view, I like the cases of distributed system propagations exemplified by
the ARPANET collapse of 1980, the AT&amp;T collapse of 1990, and a series of
propagating power outages.  These and many other incidents should make
us wonder about the quality of professional programming practice.  One
recent example involved the computer crashes when a group of new F-22
airplanes crossed the 180-degree longitude for the first time, resulting in a
major loss of navigability.  I'm also much concerned about the general
overreliance on inappropriate applications of technology, as in the rush
to all-electronic election systems.  But I try to avoid picking one
favorite risk, when it is the ongoing totality of riskfulness that is most
salient.
(My 2006 IEEE ACSAC paper, Risks of Untrustworthiness
(<a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/acsac06.pdf">http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/acsac06.pdf</a>), provides a retrospective consideration of some classes
of risks rather than just specific risks.)</p>

<p><em><strong>Can you identify five of the most important publications that
you have authored that you feel should be required reading for software
engineers and computer scientists?</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>The Role of Motherhood in the Pop Art of System Programming, ACM
Second Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, Gatlinburg TN, October
1969. This paper is somewhat dated, but may be historically interesting.</li>

<li>PSOS: Provably Secure Operating System, 1980, and the 2003 IEEE ACSAC
Classic paper revisiting it:
<a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/acsac03.pdf">http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/acsac03.pdf</a>.
PSOS represents the formally specified design of a strongly-typed 
composable system.</li>

<li>Computer-Related Risks, Addison-Wesley and ACM Press, 1995.  This book
is still highly relevant, despite its age.</li>

<li>Principled Assuredly Trustworthy Composable Architectures,
final report for DARPA, 28 December 2004: 
<a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/chats4.html">http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/chats4.html</a> for browsing, also .pdf and .ps.</li>

<li>Holistic Systems, SIGSOFT <em>SEN</em> vol. 31, no. 6, pages 4-5,
November 2006. (See the online SEN archive and also
<a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/holistic.pdf">http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/holistic.pdf</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>What advice do you have for today's computer science/software
engineering students?</strong></em></p>

<p>See the big picture.  If you are interested in solving small problems,
consider how they fit into solving bigger problems.  If you are
interested in solving big problems, be sure you can predictably compose those
solutions out of smaller solutions, analyzing the compositions iteratively in
terms of properties of the constituent subsystems.</p>

<p><em><strong>What pressing problems do you see are facing software engineers
today?</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>Developing system architectures and software engineering disciplines
that enable predictable composability of trustworthy systems.</li>

<li>Learning not just about how to program widgets, but also about what
you might have to do to make a system assuredly secure, reliable, safe,
and survivable in the face of malfunctions, misuse, and other problems.</li>

<li>Making formal methods an integral part of curricula, training, and
certain aspects of system development.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Do you think licensing software engineers is a viable way to 
force software engineers to keep current in the latest theories of
software engineering and computer science?</strong></em></p>

<p>Not really.  The best places to start involve better educational
programs that address theory and practice of developing complex systems,
developing incentives for long-term total-system optimization, and penalizing
flagrant abuses.  Licensing might make sense if there were established metrics
for good practice, but I am very suspicious of exam processes that try to
reduce competence to the ability to answer simplistic questions.</p>

<p><em><strong>Given your position to be able to take a long view of history,
do you think things are getting better, worse, or staying the same in
regards to computer-related risks and software development
processes?</strong></em></p>

<p>Software development is slowly improving, although it is basically still
an art form that is far from being an engineering discipline.  However,
relative to our increased dependence on computers and communications
(especially for life-critical and other vital applications), pervasive
persistence of prevailing types of system vulnerabilities, increased
sophistication of well-motivated threats, overdependence on skilled and
omnipresent system administration, and consequential damages, I think
the risks are increasing rather than decreasing.</p>

<p><em><strong>From reading articles and your bio on your website,
I see that you are a member of the U.S. Government Accountability Office
Executive Council on Information Management and Technology.  From this I
infer that over the years you've had a close working relationship with the
U.S. Government on the issue of computer-related risks.  What is the most
difficult issue for members of our government to understand about
computer-related risks?</strong></em></p>

<p>Complexity.  Unless someone has been burned by system failures, he or
she is not likely to understand the difficulties of designing,
implementing, operating, maintaining, procuring, and specifying systems that
must satisfy critical requirements.  People tend to oversimplify anything
that seems too complex to understand, with many ensuing risks.</p>

<p><em><strong>Can you identify any "root causes" or repeating problems in
software project development that are (or have been) particularly hard to
eradicate?</strong></em></p>

<p>Why do we still have buffer overflows and unchecked variables?  Why do
we still have operating systems that cannot protect themselves against
themselves, and are therefore susceptible to malware?  Why do we
continue to build systems that fall apart by themselves, sometimes even
without any users?  Why do we keep hearing about massive development
failures (e.g., the IRS and Air Traffic Control modernizations), with
multibillion-dollar expenditures?  Many of the root causes were understood
in the 1960s. Speaking of root causes, why do we build systems with overly
powerful root privileges?</p>
 
<p><em><strong>My belief (and fear) is that it would take a Super-Human
Organization filled with Super-Human Software Engineers to design and build
anything that is Complex, yet perfectly Reliable, Maintainable, Safe, and
Secure. That is, that there is an unbridgable gap between what society needs
and wants, and what practicing software engineers are capable of doing
to fill those needs on time and in budget. 
Do you think that an average organization filled with average
computer programmers has a chance?</strong></em></p>

<p>For Super-Complex Super-Critical Systems, the chances are very slim --
unless there are carefully crafted sound requirements, sound and well
understood fundamental principles, sound overall system architectures
that are inherently capable of satisfying those requirements, disciplined
development, predictably trustworthy composability, sensible human
interfaces, and rigidly enforced formally based software engineering
disciplines with sound development tools that are consistently used.
And that is just for starters.</p>

<p><em><strong>Are there any organizations or activities the average software
engineer and computer science student can join to become more involved to
help make the public more aware of and perhaps reduce computer-related
risks?</strong></em></p>

<p>Read and contribute to the ACM Risks Forum, or at least read the edited
highlights from it in <em>SEN</em>.  Please read my Holistic Systems
two-pager in the
<a href="http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?linked=1&part=newsletter&idx=J728&coll=portal&dl=ACM">November 2006 issue of <em>SEN</em></a>.
  I really believe that
viewing systems holistically is the only viable way of the future.  However, I
hope that reaction to that article is not merely a paraphrase of something
Butler Lampson once said about capability-based system architecture:
<em>it is the way of the future, and always will be</em>.

<p><em><strong>You lead a very active professional life. What do you do for
relaxation?</strong></em></p>

Playing duos, trios, quartets, quintets, and instrumental groups, with
my wife and others; tai chi and exercise; holistic health.

<p><em><strong>What question did I not ask, but should have?</strong></em></p>

<p>Q.  Am I going to write another RISKS book or do a second edition?<p>

<p>A.  No.  Everything recent is accessible online now, the 1995 book is
still almost completely relevant today, and I keep writing more papers,
hoping that people will read them.  See my website and the RISKS site for
more.</p>

<p>Q.  Why do you keep using the middle initial "G"?</p>

<p>A.  Dr. Peter M. Neumann is an Oxford professor of mathematics, whom I
first met in 1962.  Dr. Peter J. Neumann is director of the center for
Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts and Harvard.  A
photographic artist in NYC and an organist/conductor in Germany also
have the same first and last names, although they both evidently
eschew any middle initial.  In that I am involved in mathematics, health,
art, and music, it seems that a little disambiguation might go a long
way.</p>

<p><em><strong>Thank you, Peter, for talking to us.</strong></em></p>

<p>Robert, you are most welcome.  Thanks for asking.</p>
