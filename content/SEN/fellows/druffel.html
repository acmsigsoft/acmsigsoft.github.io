<p><strong><em>Elaborate on the work leading up to your achieving the distinction of ACM Fellow:</em></strong><br>
My selection was for leadership in managing national-level software programs
including: the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) software
research program, the Ada program, the Software Technology for Affordable,
Reliable Systems (STARS), and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).
These activities were primarily in the decade of the late 70's through the
late 80's when software was not a household word and there was little
coherence or direction in the software community.  I do not suggest that I
provided that coherence - only that the programs I managed served as
catalysts for addressing the issues and establishing the agendas.  Many
people made the needed technical contributions.</P>

<p>I am also proud to have been part of the Rational Software team during its
early days.  I believe we brought some important software engineering
concepts to product.</P>

<p><strong><em>What is the best reference to your work (book or paper, full citation)?</em></strong><br>
Probably the best single reference is the special issue of IEEE Computer
(<I>IEEE Computer</I>, November 1983, 21-29) for which I was one of the
guest editors.  It shows the breadth of issues and provides insight into how
those issues were framed.  It also illustrates that there were many technical
people involved.</P>

<p><strong><em>What are your current research interests?</em></strong><br>
My primary role these days is management.  I have not conducted personal
research of any significance for quite a while.  However, I have an intense
interest in the SCRA work on privacy, protection of information systems for
healthcare, and computer forensics.  Much of this interest stems from the
Computer Emergency Response Team experience and my participation on several
studies on the vulnerability of our information infrastructure.  I am also
interested in software architectures and the role that sensor-based
computing will play in future software architectures.</P>

<p><strong><em>What are your current outside interests?</em></strong><br>
My interests are our six grandchildren, photography, tennis, bicycling and
growing roses.  I try to combine those interests as often as possible.  For
instance, since the grandchildren came along, I've converted from wildlife
photography to child photography, which is just as challenging since both
subjects are in constant motion.  As they mature, I plan to involve our
grandchildren in my bicycle trips and teach them to play tennis.</P>

<p><strong><em>What was the greatest influence on you?</em></strong><br>
My grandfather was a self-taught engineer.  He had to quit school after the
sixth grade to help his widowed mother support his younger siblings.
Through self-study, he became an engineer and eventually chief engineer at
Otis Elevator.  He instilled in me the importance of education as a lifelong
exercise, and by example helped me see engineering as a profession that
improves people's quality of life.</P>

<p><strong><em>What was your greatest influence?</em></strong><br>
Probably the greatest influence was as director of the Software Engineering
Institute during its formative years from 1986-1996.  By influencing the SEI
agenda, I had the opportunity to work with a broad segment of the community
and I hope exert some influence. </P>

<p><strong><em>Who do you think has made the greatest impact on software engineering?</em></strong><br>
I don't think you can single out one person as having had the greatest impact.
NO one person defined the field and many have made important contributions.
There are several people whose contributions I respect: John Backus, Barry
Boehm, Fred Brooks, Nico Habermann, Dave Parnas, and Bill Wulf.  I also
include Mike Devlin, co-founder and technical visionary behind Rational
Software, and Tim Standish, recently retired from UC Irvine.  Their
contributions are much less known but no less substantial.  Both are
visionaries and both had the perseverance to turn their ideas into working
systems. </P>

<p><strong><em>What's your favorite story about software engineering development?</em></strong><br>
In the early years at Rational, when development of the environment product
was well under way, we realized that we had left out an important
functionality.  Our choice was to add it on or integrate it into the
environment, which meant making a significant change to the architecture.
We stopped development for over a month at a very critical time to make the
architectural changes.  Although it was a difficult and painful decision, in
retrospect, I believe it made the product successful.  The important lesson
is that the entire team was willing to follow our own dictum to maintain the
integrity of the architecture rather than let it erode.</P>

<p><strong><em>Which computer-related areas are most in need of investment by government, business or education?</em></strong><br>
Information systems security and privacy are way ahead of everything else in
terms of needed attention.   It appears that the funding is about to increase
dramatically.   The community will need to respond with great ideas to make
good use of the additional funding.</P>

<p><strong><em>What advice do you have for computer science/software engineering students?</em></strong><br>
Software engineers face enormous challenges.   We are building systems that
have so much complexity that they require deep thought, innovation, and
discipline.  Entire enterprises, even people's safety often may depend on
your work.   Approach your work as a profession and devote your study and
energy to it as a lifelong profession.</P>

<p><strong><em>What is the most often-overlooked risk in software engineering?</em></strong><br>
Inadequate design consideration for eliminating unexpected consequences, and
then testing for them.  We have too many systems out there with undocumented
features.</P>

<p><strong><em>What is the most repeated mistake in software engineering?</em></strong><br>
Not making the software architecture explicit and when it is explicit, not
maintaining the integrity of the architecture as it evolves (including when
it is fielded and under evolution).</P>

<p><strong><em>What are the most exciting/promising software engineering ideas or techniques on the horizon?</em></strong><br>
Characterization of software architectures and analysis techniques for
determining those architectural features that most affect the non-functional
attributes of a system.  Although these notions have been on the horizon for
some time, I believe they are still "on the horizon."  When we understand
them, then some of the other elusive "horizon" opportunities such as reuse
will be much more within our grasp.</P>

<p><strong><em>What are your plans for the future or the next five years?</em></strong><br>
In the near term, I would like to see us get the mechanisms in place to
protect our infrastructure systems, particularly healthcare.  I believe that
the software community can do an enormous amount to improve delivery of
healthcare.  I also believe we have a lot to contribute to distance learning.
In the longer term, although I don't have a time frame, I would like to
engage in personal research in distance learning.  I also want to take
advantage of the opportunities it promises to further my own education in
areas outside computing that I have so long neglected.</P>

<p><em>Thank you!</em></p>
