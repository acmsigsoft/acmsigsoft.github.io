                  <p>Repaying all technical debt (TD) present in a system may be unfeasible, as there is
                     typically a shortage in the resources allocated for TD repayment. Therefore, TD prioritization
                     is essential to best allocate such resources to determine which TD items are to be
                     repaid first and which items are to be delayed until later releases. This study conducts
                     a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify and analyze the currently researched
                     TD prioritization approaches. The employed search strategy strove to achieve high
                     completeness through the identification of a quasi-gold standard set, which was used
                     to establish a search string to automatically retrieve papers from select research
                     databases. The application of selection criteria, along with forward and backward
                     snowballing, identified 24 TD prioritization approaches. The analysis of the identified
                     approaches revealed a scarcity of approaches that account for cost, value, and resources
                     constraint and a lack of industry evaluation. Furthermore, this SLR unveils potential
                     gaps in the current TD prioritization research, which future research may explore.

                  <p>Technical Debt (TD) can be paid back either by those that incurred it or by others.
                     We call the former self-fixed TD, and it is particularly effective, as developers
                     are experts in their own code and are best-suited to fix the corresponding TD issues.
                     To what extent is TD self-fixed, which types of TD are more likely to be self-fixed
                     and is the remediation time of self-fixed TD shorter than non-self-fixed TD? This
                     paper attempts to answer these questions. It reports on an empirical study that analyzes
                     the self-fixed issues of five types of TD (i.e., Code, Defect, Design, Documentation
                     and Test), captured via static analysis, in more than 17,000 commits from 20 Python
                     projects of the Apache Software Foundation. The results show that more than two thirds
                     of the issues are self-fixed and that the self-fixing rate is negatively correlated
                     with the number of commits, developers and project size. Furthermore, the survival
                     time of self-fixed issues is generally shorter than non-self-fixed issues. Moreover,
                     the majority of Defect Debt tends to be self-fixed and has a shorter survival time,
                     while Test Debt and Design Debt are likely to be fixed by other developers. These
                     results can benefit both researchers and practitioners by aiding the prioritization
                     of TD remediation activities within development teams, and by informing the development
                     of TD management tools.

                  <p>When developing software, it is vitally important to keep the level of technical debt
                     down since it is well established from several studies that technical debt can, e.g.,
                     lower the development productivity, decrease the developers' morale, and compromise
                     the overall quality of the software. However, even if researchers and practitioners
                     working in today's software development industry are quite familiar with the concept
                     of technical debt and its related negative consequences, there has been no empirical
                     research focusing specifically on how software managers actively communicate and manage
                     the need to keep the level of technical debt as low as possible.
                  </p> 
                  <p>This paper aims to explore how software companies <em>encourage</em> and <em>reward</em> practitioners for actively keeping the level of technical debt down and also whether
                     the companies use any <em>forcing</em> or <em>penalizing</em> initiatives when managing technical debt.

                  <p>This paper reports the results of both an online web-survey provided quantitative
                     data from 258 participants and follow-up interviews with 32 industrial software practitioners.
                     The findings show that having a TD management strategy can significantly impact the
                     amount of TD in the software. When surveying how commonly used different TD management
                     strategies are, we found that only the encouraging strategy is, to some extent, adopted
                     in today's' software industry. This study also provides a model describing the four
                     assessed strategies by presenting its strategies and tactics, together with recommendations
                     on how they could be operationalized in today's software companies.

                  <p>Bad smells are symptoms of bad design choices implemented on the source code. They
                     are one of the key indicators of technical debts, specifically, design debt. To manage
                     this kind of debt, it is important to be aware of bad smells and refactor them whenever
                     possible. Therefore, several bad smell detection tools and techniques have been proposed
                     over the years. These tools and techniques present different strategies to perform
                     detections. More recently, machine learning algorithms have also been proposed to
                     support bad smell detection. However, we lack empirical evidence on the accuracy and
                     efficiency of these machine learning based techniques. In this paper, we present an
                     evaluation of seven different machine learning algorithms on the task of detecting
                     four types of bad smells. We also provide an analysis of the impact of software metrics
                     for bad smell detection using a unified approach for interpreting the models' decisions.
                     We found that with the right optimization, machine learning algorithms can achieve
                     good performance (F1 score) for two bad smells: <em>God Class (0.86)</em> and <em>Refused Parent Bequest (0.67).</em> We also uncovered which metrics play fundamental roles for detecting each bad smell.

                  <p>Technical Debt (TD) has proven to be a suitable communication concept for software-intensive
                     contexts to raise awareness regarding longterm negative effects of deviations from
                     standards and guidelines. TD has also been introduced to systems engineering domain,
                     to communicate design shortcomings in long-running, software-assisted systems. We
                     analysed potential TD in the engineering data exchange for production system engineering.
                     Similar to requirements engineering in software-intensive systems, data exchange in
                     the design phase plays an integral part in Software Engineering (SE) for Production
                     Systems Engineering: Specifications, and physical logic have to be derived from heterogeneous
                     plant models or parameter tables designed by different stakeholders. However, traditional
                     procedures and inadequate tool support lead to inefficient data extraction and integration.
                     We identified debt arising from knowledge representation, data model and the exchange
                     process. The refinement validation of identified TD was achieved through semi-structured
                     interviews with representatives in two analysed companies. In an online survey with
                     ten participants from an industrial consortium we evaluated whether the identified
                     TD concepts also applied to other companies, which is true for the majority of TD.
                     Furthermore, we discuss promising TD management strategies to repay and manage negative
                     effects and the accumulation of additional debt, such as improved communication, test-driven
                     model engineering and visualisation of engineering models.

                  <p>Technical debt is a metaphor that measures the additional effort needed to continue
                     to add more features in a software due to its inherent decrease in code quality. Most
                     software systems suffer from technical debt at some point so that dedicated tools
                     and metrics have been developed to monitor such debt. Alongside tools, appropriate
                     engineering practices must be put in place by the development team to keep that debt
                     at an acceptable level. In this empirical study, we observed and surveyed Scrum development
                     teams composed of experienced students in order to understand their quality-related
                     processes on a year-long academic project. We found that (1) students do use static
                     analysis tools of many forms, but their actual usage is limited due to time pressure;
                     (2) retrospective and non-constraining feedback on code quality has little to no effect,
                     even when given regularly during the course of the project; and (3) junior developers
                     value composite quality indicators <em>(e.g.</em>, maintainability, reliability in <em>SonarQube</em>), even if they do not fully understand their meaning. From our findings, we propose
                     a series of recommendations, both technical and methodological, on how to train junior
                     developers to understand and manage technical debt.

                     an energy "interest". This interest will keep increasing as new versions of the software
                     are released, and eventually reach a point where the interest will be higher than
                     the initial energy debt. Addressing the issues/smells at such a point can remove energy
                     debt, at the cost of having already consumed a significant amount of energy which
                     can translate into high costs. We present all underlying concepts of energy debt,
                     bridging the connection with the existing concept of technical debt and show how to
                     compute the energy debt through a motivational example.

                  <p>Context The micro-services architectural pattern advocates for the partitioning of functionality
                     into loosely coupled services, which should be backward compatible, to enable independent
                     upgrades. Deprecation is commonly used as a tool to manage multiple versions of methods
                     or services. However, deprecation carries a cost in that tests might be duplicated
                     and might rely on services that have become deprecated over time.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Objective Using the terms of the Technical Debt metaphor, we explore the consequences of deprecation,
                     and how it has affected the test base during seven years.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method We take an exploratory approach, reporting on experiences found before and after
                     servicing parts of the incurred Technical Debt. We mine code repositories and validate
                     our findings with experienced developers.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results We found that the growth of deprecation debt varied a lot. Some services experienced
                     substantial growth, but most did not. Unit tests, where deprecation is visible in
                     the developers' tools, were much less affected than integration tests, which lack
                     such visualization mechanisms. While servicing debt of 121 out of 285 deprecated services,
                     we discovered that up to 29% of the spent effort could be attributed to accrued interest.
                     However, this is an upper bound; there could be less impact, depending on whether
                     scripting could be used to service the debt or not.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusion This paper illustrates that integration tests can be viewed as a debt from the perspective
                     of deprecated services. While the pattern was that deprecated services (debt principal)
                     experienced no or little accrued interest, some, highly used, services experienced
                     a lot, particularly during stressful times. Java-based tests, where deprecation is
                     visible in the IDE, did not experience a similar pattern of increasing debt. We postulate
                     that deprecation debt should be kept visible, either using developer tools or statistical
                     reports.

                  <p><em>Background:</em> There is a growing body of knowledge on Technical Debt (TD) in recent years. This
                     knowledge provides various explanations of the term and suggests different remedies
                     for it. However, the knowledge is yet to be validated in software development processes.
                     <em>Aims:</em> The objective of this study is twofold. First, to get empirical insight on the understanding
                     and the use of the TD concept in Serbian IT industry. Second, to contribute towards
                     precise conceptualization of the TD concept. <em>Method:</em> We conducted a national-wide survey to collect feedback from industry practitioners.
                     The survey is a part of InsighTD-an international initiative to investigate causes
                     and effects of TD. <em>Results:</em> In total, 93 responses were collected, mostly from developers. Results indicate that
                     the concept of TD is not widely accepted for use by the industry, only 35% of practitioners
                     have practical experiences with projects that explicitly considered or managed TD.
                     The most common types of TD are: code, test and design debt that together account
                     for 61% of all reported cases. The archetypal TD case is caused by a tight schedule
                     and resulted with non-optimal solutions that are difficult to evolve and in constant
                     need of rework. <em>Conclusions:</em> Implications are at one hand for academics, who should consider TD as a topic for
                     their curriculums since the results revealed that novice developers are unfamiliar
                     with the concept. At the other hand, industry practitioners have a well aligned understanding
                     of the TD concept, which is consistent with TD literature. However, we perceive that
                     the wider use of the existing tools and techniques for managing TD can significantly
                     help practitioners to deal with the top three occurring TD types.

                  <p>Systems Engineering is a matter of the perspective and scope where several principles
                     of the systems thinking approach coincide. Following the fundamental system principle
                     of holism and interaction theory, in order to understand the whole the system should
                     be considered as a whole. Due to the phenomena of emergence, not all properties of
                     a system can be determined or explained by its components alone. The conceptual model
                     of Technical Debt already recognize the context sensitivity of Technical Debt as an
                     essential factor and identifies phenomena that fall outside the core definition of
                     Technical Debt as a major part of future research.
                  </p> 
                  <p>This short paper shows why managing the parts does not equal managing the whole by
                     introducing Technical Debt as an emergent characteristic and why the traditional Technical
                     Debt-Management methods can only be partially applied to Systems of Systems.

                  <p>With the adoption of microservices architectural styles, practitioners started noticing
                     increasing pitfalls in managing and maintaining such architectures, with the risk
                     of introducing architectural debt. Previous studies identified different <em>microservice smells</em> (also named <em>anti-patterns</em>) that harm microservices architectures. However, according to our knowledge, there
                     are no tools that can automatically detect microservice smells, so their identification
                     is left to the experience of the developer. In this paper, we extend an existing tool
                     developed for the detection of architectural smells to explore microservices architecture
                     through the detection of three microservice smells: Cyclic Dependencies, Hard-Coded
                     Endpoints, and Shared Persistence. We detected the smells on five open-source projects
                     implemented with microservices and manually validated the precision of the detection
                     results. This work aims to open new perspectives on facing and studying architectural
                     debt in the field of microservices architectures.

                  <p>Nowadays, industrial research labs operate like startups. In a relatively short amount
                     of time, researchers are expected not only to explore innovative ideas but also show
                     how the new ideas can add value to the organisation. One way to do this, especially
                     when developing tools, is to construct usable prototypes. When the technology underlying
                     the research tool is highly complex or niche, like program analysis, field trials
                     with potential users also help explaining and demonstrating the benefits of the tool.
                     Getting support from potential users helps demonstrate value to the organisation,
                     which in turn justifies conducting more extensive research and investing more resources
                     to enhance the initial prototype.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Thus, research that involves the construction of tools need to manage both short and
                     long term risk, and the technical debt that arises throughout the lifecycle of a research
                     prototype. As not all prototypes will result in a technology transfer, one has to
                     carefully manage the project resources dedicated to paying the technical debt. For
                     example, failure to pay the debt early in the project might result in unstable prototypes
                     that can have a negative influence on potential customers and make technology transfer
                     harder. On the other hand, over committing resources to reduce the technical debt
                     might result in slower research progress and failure to show improvement over state-of-the-art.

                     projects. at Oracle Labs Australia.

                  <p>Context: Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor used to describe technical decisions that
                     can give the company a benefit in the short term but possibly hurting the overall
                     quality of the software in the long term. Objective: This study aims to characterize
                     the current state of practices related to TD payment from the point of view of software
                     practitioners. Method: We used a survey research method to collect and analyze - both
                     quantitatively and qualitatively - a corpus of responses from a survey of 432 software
                     practitioners from Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and the United States, as a part of the
                     InsighTD project. Results: We were able to identify that refactoring (24.3%) was the
                     main practice related to TD payment, along with improving testing (6.2%) and improve
                     design (5.8%). Also, we identify that small-sized systems and big-sized systems, along
                     with young systems (less than one year) tend to use more refactoring. As a part of
                     these results, we also could identify that some practices do not eliminate the debt
                     by itself, but support a favorable scenario for TD payment or prevention. Additionally,
                     after comparing the three major TD types cited (code debt, test debt and design debt)
                     we could discover an important similarity of TD payment practices between code debt
                     and design debt. Lastly, we identified that no matter the cause leading to TD occurrence,
                     refactoring remained the most common practice. Conclusion: Definition of practices
                     related to TD payment is an essential activity for software development teams. Developing
                     healthy software systems that can be maintained in the future requires that companies
                     find the right approaches for TD payment.

                  <p>As the development progresses, software projects tend to accumulate Technical Debt
                     and become harder to maintain. Multiple tools exist with the mission to help practitioners
                     to better manage Technical Debt. Despite this progress, there is a lack of tools providing
                     actionable and self-learned suggestions to practitioners aimed at mitigating the impact
                     of Technical Debt in real projects. We aim to create a data-driven, lightweight, and

                  <p>In this paper we present Software Archinaut-a tool used to help identify technical
                     debt hotspots in an architecture, and manage the evolution of the architecture once
                     these hotspots are discovered. Archinaut is a platform that integrates analyses from
                     different tools. It supports three main usage scenarios: 1) understanding the architecture,
                     2) identifying technical debt hotspots, and 3) monitoring and controlling the evolution
                     of the architecture. We illustrate these scenarios by using Apache Kafka as an example.
