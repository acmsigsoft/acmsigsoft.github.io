                  <p>Developers of deep learning applications (shortened as application developers) commonly
                     use deep learning frameworks in their projects. However, due to time pressure, market
                     competition, and cost reduction, developers of deep learning frameworks (shortened
                     as framework developers) often have to sacrifice software quality to satisfy a shorter
                     completion time. This practice leads to technical debt in deep learning frameworks,
                     which results in the increasing burden to both the application developers and the
                     framework developers in future development.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In this paper, we analyze the comments indicating technical debt (self-admitted technical
                     debt) in 7 of the most popular open-source deep learning frameworks. Although framework
                     developers are aware of such technical debt, typically the application developers
                     are not. We find that: 1) there is a significant number of technical debt in all the
                     studied deep learning frameworks. 2) there is design debt, defect debt, documentation
                     debt, test debt, requirement debt, compatibility debt, and algorithm debt in deep
                     learning frameworks. 3) the majority of the technical debt in deep learning framework
                     is design debt (24.07% - 65.27%), followed by requirement debt (7.09% - 31.48%) and
                     algorithm debt (5.62% - 20.67%). In some projects, compatibility debt accounts for
                     more than 10%. These findings illustrate that technical debt is common in deep learning
                     frameworks, and many types of technical debt also impact the deep learning applications.
                     Based on our findings, we highlight future research directions and provide recommendations
                     for practitioners.

                  <p>We present an approach for platform-agnostic application modelling, complemented by
                     an execution and lifecycle management protocol. It enables a systematic way of generating
                     native applications capable of leveraging specific features and sensors for any target
                     device while contextualizing them to the needs of the application logic. In addition,
                     it provides a way to maintain and update all the deployed instances simultaneously
                     across the variety of target devices, without requiring client-side intervention.

                  <p>The application modelling is geared towards non-technical users, giving them the means

                     of client platforms such as mobile devices or voice assistants without worrying about
                     device-level programming. When required, the generated applications can be quickly
                     customized for better end-user experience by developers with device knowledge, starting
                     from generated code and leveraging the same cloud-based application logic.

                  <p>Trust is a major aspect in the relationship between humans and autonomous safety-critical
                     systems, such as autonomous vehicles. Although human errors may cause higher risks,
                     failures of autonomous systems are more strongly perceived by the general population,
                     which hinders the adoption of autonomous safety-critical systems. It is therefore
                     necessary to devise approaches for systematically building trust in autonomous functions
                     and thereby facilitate the adoption process. In this paper, we introduce a method
                     and a framework for incrementally building trust in the context of autonomous driving.
                     Within the envisioned solution, we employ the psychological narrative behind trust
                     building through the formation of new habits and introduce a method where trust is
                     established gradually for both the human and the autonomous safety-critical system
                     via reputation building and step-by-step integration of smart software agents replacing
                     human actions.

                  <p>Community smells have been defined as sub-optimal organizational structures that may
                     lead to social debt. Previous studies have shown that they are highly diffused in
                     both open- and closed-source projects, are perceived as harmful by practitioners,
                     and can even lead to the introduction of technical debt in source code. Despite the
                     presence of this body of research, little is known on the practitioners' perceived
                     prominence of community smells in practice as well as on the strategies adopted to
                     deal with them. This paper aims at bridging this gap by proposing an empirical study
                     in which 76 software practitioners are inquired on (i) the prominence of four well-known
                     community smells, <em>i.e.</em>, Organizational Silo, Black Cloud, Lone Wolf, and Radio Silence, in their contexts
                     and (ii) the methods they adopted to "refactor" them. Our results first reveal that
                     community smells frequently manifest themselves in software projects and, more importantly,
                     there exist specific refactoring practices to deal with each of the considered community
                     smells.

                  <p>Combined sewer overflows represent significant risks to human health as untreated
                     water is discharged to the environment. Municipalities recently began collecting large

                     a novel metamorphic relation to characterize RNN robustness in the presence of missing
                     data. We show how this relation drives automated testing of three implementation variants:
                     LSTM, GRU, and IndRNN thereby uncovering deficiencies and suggesting more robust solutions
                     for overflow prediction.

                  <p>Background: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software was originally conceived for manufacturing
                     contexts and has later been generalized to cover service contexts as well. In hospitals,
                     adoption was accelerated by an increasing commodification and marketization of health
                     care.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Questions: What impact do the manufacturing roots of SAP ERP have when the software is applied
                     for service delivery in a hospital?
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: A typical-case Yin Case Study about the surgery planning and execution processes
                     in a large university hospital.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: One goal of the ERP implementation was to optimize the utilization of the operation
                     rooms (ORs). This goal was largely missed because of too-low quality of planning data
                     effectuated intentionally by the surgeons in order to pursue micropolitical agendas.
                     This was possible because the software paid no attention to micropolitics at all,
                     largely due to its roots in manufacturing and hidden by higher software layers that
                     claimed to be adapted to the hospital domain.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: Apparently, successful complex reusable application software can create a <em>domain paradigm</em> that subsequently creates product risk by being inappropriately and neglectfully
                     extended into other domains where it does not apply. Software engineering should become
                     aware of this effect and perform research to control it.

                     we argue that the SE community should use SE conferences as the focal points for activities
                     that benefit society at the locations of the conferences, and make such activities
                     an integral, valued, and recognized part of the conference programs. The proposed
                     series of events, termed SE Cares, can follow and learn from the model of Requirements
                     Engineering (RE) Cares events that took place in 2018 and 2019, and can be a co-located
                     event at all interested SE-related conferences.

                  <p>Limited consideration of users' values in mobile applications (apps) can lead to user
                     disappointments and negative socio-economic consequences. Therefore, it is important
                     to consider values in app development to avoid such adverse effects and to secure
                     the optimum use of apps. With this aim, we conducted a case study to identify the
                     users' desired values that are either reflected or missing in the existing Bangladeshi
                     agriculture mobile apps. We manually analyzed 1522 reviews from 29 existing Bangladeshi
                     agriculture apps in Google Play by following a widely used human values theory, Schwartz's
                     theory of basic human values. Our results show that users of the selected apps have
                     twenty one (21) desired individual values where eleven (11) values are reflected in
                     the apps and ten (10) values are missing. This research provides a basis for the developers
                     to design apps that consider users' values. It also provides a direction on which
                     values they should address while developing apps. Moreover, repeating this research
                     in different domains or societies would result in society-oriented apps that are more
                     sensitive to users' values.

                  <p>The children born nowadays are called <em>digital natives</em>, but their digital skills are under the expectations of the future workforce, which
                     will be tremendously digital. Education has a key role in supporting the development
                     of digital skills even from the early childhood. Designing educational software for
                     preschoolers, that would support learning and digital skills development, needs focus
                     both on children (to ensure engagement) and their instructors (to ensure appropriateness
                     and acceptance). Edutainment software possesses educational content and an entertainment
                     model, being a promising perspective in education support. In this paper we propose
                     a user-centered design method that focuses on both users categories (preschoolers
                     and kindergarten teachers) and that consists of two steps: product development and
                     product validation. A case study of applying and assessing the proposed method to
                     design educational software for preschoolers is also presented.

                  <p>The typical hiring pipeline for software engineering occurs over several stages---from
                     phone screening and technical on-site interviews, to offer and negotiation. When these
                     hiring pipelines are "leaky," otherwise qualified candidates are lost at some stage
                     of the pipeline. These leaky pipelines impact companies in several ways, including
                     hindering a company's ability to recruit competitive candidates and build diverse
                     software teams.
                  </p> 
                  <p>To understand where candidates become disengaged in the hiring pipeline---and what
                     companies can do to prevent it---we conducted a qualitative study on over 10,000 reviews
                     on 19 companies from Glassdoor, a website where candidates can leave reviews about
                     their hiring process experiences. We identified several poor practices which prematurely
                     sabotage the hiring process---for example, not adequately communicating hiring criteria,
                     conducting interviews with inexperienced interviewers, and ghosting candidates. Our
                     findings provide a set of guidelines to help companies improve their hiring pipeline
                     practices---such as being deliberate about phrasing and language during initial contact
                     with the candidate, providing candidates with constructive feedback after their interviews,
                     and bringing salary transparency and long-term career discussions into offers and
                     negotiations. Operationalizing these guidelines helps make the hiring pipeline more
                     transparent, fair, and inclusive.

                  <p>People with intellectual disabilities (IDs) often have a sedentary lifestyle that
                     can lead to long-term issues like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and depression.
                     Few games and apps promoting physical activity for people with IDs exist, and they
                     do not have a focus on the motivational aspect. This paper aims to find how to develop
                     software that can motivate people with IDs to do physical activity outdoors. For this
                     purpose, we have followed a design and creation research strategy using several qualitative
                     methods such as semi-structured interviews with health care workers, special education
                     experts and software engineers; a focus group with occupational therapists, physical
                     therapists and software engineers; and a preliminary pilot user test with 3 users
                     and 2 caregivers aiming to a test of the software on the field and at the refinement
                     of its specifications. Having social interaction during the physical activity turned
                     out to be a major motivational aspect of the system, whereas rewards systems did not
                     attract much of the users' attention. Regarding the adapted navigational assistance,
                     easy-to-read text, visual communication and street-level pictures were the key features
                     to achieve successful and understandable guidance outdoors for people with intellectual
                     disabilities.

                  <p>This paper introduces an integrated framework for sustainability and urban security
                     socio-technical systems. The focus is to design and develop a hardware/software system

                  <p>The paper explains the steps taken through developing the Uffizi Museum crowd monitoring
                     and queue management system. The goal of implementing such system was to remove queues
                     outside the Museum which is in line with urban security and visitors comfort. We took
                     advantage of a data-driven approach mapped on sustainability framework. Such approach
                     which was fed with both real-time sensory data and prediction models, successfully
                     eliminated long queues to access the museum. We took into consideration performance
                     of software system as well to reduce the response time to a threshold that is compliant
                     with real-time requirements. We started our experiments from fall 2016 and operationalized
                     it in October, 2018. During this experimentation period, we learned a lot of lessons
                     that we report in this paper.
