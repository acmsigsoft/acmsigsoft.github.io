                  <p>Background: Meeting the growing industry demand for Data Science requires cross-disciplinary
                     teams that can translate machine learning research into production-ready code. Software
                     engineering teams value adherence to coding standards as an indication of code readability,
                     maintainability, and developer expertise. However, there are no large-scale empirical
                     studies of coding standards focused specifically on Data Science projects. Aims: This
                     study investigates the extent to which Data Science projects follow code standards.
                     In particular, which standards are followed, which are ignored, and how does this
                     differ to traditional software projects? Method: We compare a corpus of 1048 Open-Source
                     Data Science projects to a reference group of 1099 non-Data Science projects with
                     a similar level of quality and maturity. Results: Data Science projects suffer from
                     a significantly higher rate of functions that use an excessive numbers of parameters
                     and local variables. Data Science projects also follow different variable naming conventions
                     to non-Data Science projects. Conclusions: The differences indicate that Data Science
                     codebases are distinct from traditional software codebases and do not follow traditional
                     software engineering conventions. Our conjecture is that this may be because traditional
                     software engineering conventions are inappropriate in the context of Data Science
                     projects.

                  <p>Background: The Systems Engineering and Software Engineering disciplines are highly
                     intertwined in most modern Systems of Systems (SoS), and particularly so in industries
                     such as defense, transportation, energy and health care. However, the combination
                     of these disciplines during the architecting of SoS seems to be especially challenging;
                     the literature suggests that major integration and operational issues are often linked
                     to ambiguities and gaps between system-level and software-level architectures.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: The objective of this paper is to empirically investigate: 1) the state of practice
                     on the interplay between these two disciplines in the architecting process of systems
                     with SoS characteristics; 2) the problems perceived due to this interplay during said
                     architecting process; and 3) the problems arising due to the particular characteristics
                     of SoS systems.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: We conducted a questionnaire-based online survey among practitioners from
                     industries in the aforementioned domains, having a background on Systems Engineering,
                     Software Engineering or both, and experience in the architecting of systems with SoS
                     characteristics. The survey combined multiple-choice and open-ended questions, and
                     the data collected from the 60 respondents were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative
                     methods.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: We found that although in most cases the software architecting process is
                     governed by system-level requirements, the way requirements were specified by systems
                     engineers, and the lack of domain-knowledge of software engineers, often lead to misinterpretations
                     at software level. Furthermore, we found that unclear and/or incomplete specifications
                     could be a common cause of technical debt in SoS projects, which is caused, in part,
                     by insufficient interface definitions. It also appears that while the SoS concept
                     has been adopted by some practitioners in the field, the same is not true about the
                     existing and growing body of knowledge on the subject in Software Engineering resulting
                     in recurring problems with system integration. Finally, while not directly related
                     to the interplay of the two disciplines, the survey also indicates that low-level
                     hardware components, despite being identified as the root cause of undesired emergent
                     behavior, are often not considered when modeling or simulating the system.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: The survey indicates the need for tighter collaboration between the two
                     disciplines, structured around concrete guidelines and practices for reconciling their
                     differences. A number of open issues identified by this study require further investigation.

                  <p>Background. The increasing reliance on applications with machine learning (ML) components
                     calls for mature engineering techniques that ensure these are built in a robust and
                     future-proof manner.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aim. We aim to empirically determine the state of the art in how teams develop, deploy
                     and maintain software with ML components.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method. We mined both academic and grey literature and identified 29 engineering best
                     practices for ML applications. We conducted a survey among 313 practitioners to determine
                     the degree of adoption for these practices and to validate their perceived effects.
                     Using the survey responses, we quantified practice adoption, differentiated along
                     demographic characteristics, such as geography or team size. We also tested correlations
                     and investigated linear and non-linear relationships between practices and their perceived
                     effect using various statistical models.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results. Our findings indicate, for example, that larger teams tend to adopt more
                     practices, and that traditional software engineering practices tend to have lower
                     adoption than ML specific practices. Also, the statistical models can accurately predict
                     perceived effects such as agility, software quality and traceability, from the degree
                     of adoption for specific sets of practices. Combining practice adoption rates with
                     practice importance, as revealed by statistical models, we identify practices that
                     are important but have low adoption, as well as practices that are widely adopted
                     but are less important for the effects we studied.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusion. Overall, our survey and the analysis of responses received provide a quantitative
                     basis for assessment and step-wise improvement of practice adoption by ML teams.

                  <p>Background: Software engineers spend a substantial amount of time using Web search
                     to accomplish software engineering tasks. Such search tasks include finding code snippets,
                     API documentation, seeking help with debugging, etc. While debugging a bug or crash,
                     one of the common practices of software engineers is to search for information about
                     the associated error or exception traces on the internet. Aims: In this paper, we
                     analyze query logs from Bing to carry out a large scale study of software exceptions.
                     To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study to analyze how Web
                     search is used to find information about exceptions. Method: We analyzed about 1 million
                     exception related search queries from a random sample of 5 billion web search queries.
                     To extract exceptions from unstructured query text, we built a novel machine learning
                     model. With the model, we extracted exceptions from raw queries and performed popularity,
                     effort, success, query characteristic and web domain analysis. We also performed programming
                     language-specific analysis to give a better view of the exception search behavior.
                     Results: Using the model with an F1-score of 0.82, our study identifies most frequent,
                     most effort-intensive, or less successful exceptions and popularity of community Q&amp;A
                     sites. Conclusion: These techniques can help improve existing methods, documentation
                     and tools for exception analysis and prediction. Further, similar techniques can be
                     applied for APIs, frameworks, etc.

                  <p>Background: Developers spend a lot of their time on understanding source code. Static
                     code analysis tools can draw attention to code that is difficult for developers to
                     understand. However, most of the findings are based on non-validated metrics, which
                     can lead to confusion and code that is hard to understand not being identified.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: In this work, we validate a metric called Cognitive Complexity which was explicitly
                     designed to measure code understandability and which is already widely used due to
                     its integration in well-known static code analysis tools.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: We conducted a systematic literature search to obtain data sets from studies
                     which measured code understandability. This way we obtained about 24,000 understandability
                     evaluations of 427 code snippets. We calculated the correlations of these measurements
                     with the corresponding metric values and statistically summarized the correlation
                     coefficients through a meta-analysis.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: Cognitive Complexity positively correlates with comprehension time and subjective
                     ratings of understandability. The metric showed mixed results for the correlation
                     with the correctness of comprehension tasks and with physiological measures.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: It is the first validated and solely code-based metric which is able
                     to reflect at least some aspects of code understandability. Moreover, due to its methodology,
                     this work shows that code understanding is currently measured in many different ways,
                     which we also do not know how they are related. This makes it difficult to compare
                     the results of individual studies as well as to develop a metric that measures code
                     understanding in all its facets.

                  <p>Background: Given the social aspects of Software Engineering (SE), in the last twenty
                     years, researchers from the field started using research methods common in social
                     sciences such as case study, ethnography, and grounded theory. More recently, case
                     survey, another imported research method, has seen its increasing use in SE studies.
                     It is based on existing case studies reported in the literature and intends to harness
                     the generalizability of survey and the depth of case study. However, little is known
                     on how case survey has been applied in SE research, let alone guidelines on how to
                     employ it properly. Aims: This article aims to provide a better understanding of how
                     case survey has been applied in Software Engineering research. Method: To address
                     this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic mapping study and analyzed 12 Software
                     Engineering studies that used the case survey method. Results: Our findings show that
                     these studies presented a heterogeneous understanding of the approach ranging from
                     secondary studies to primary inquiries focused on a large number of instances of a
                     research phenomenon. They have not applied the case survey method consistently as
                     defined in the seminal methodological papers. Conclusions: We conclude that a set
                     of clearly defined guidelines are needed on how to use case survey in SE research,
                     to ensure the quality of the studies employing this approach and to provide a set
                     of clearly defined criteria to evaluate such work.

                  <p>Background: Docker technology has been increasingly used among software developers
                     in a multitude of projects. This growing interest is due to the fact that Docker technology
                     supports a convenient process for creating and building containers, promoting close
                     cooperation between developer and operations teams, and enabling continuous software
                     delivery. As a fast-growing technology, it is important to identify the Docker-related
                     topics that are most popular as well as existing challenges and difficulties that
                     developers face.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: This paper presents a large-scale empirical study identifying practitioners'
                     perspectives on Docker technology by mining posts from the Stack Overflow (SoF) community.
                     Method: A dataset of 113, 922 Docker-related posts was created based on a set of relevant
                     tags and contents. The dataset was cleaned and prepared. Topic modelling was conducted
                     using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), allowing the identification of dominant topics
                     in the domain. Results: Our results show that most developers use SoF to ask about
                     a broad spectrum of Docker topics including framework development, application deployment,
                     continuous integration, web-server configuration and many more. We determined that
                     30 topics that developers discuss can be grouped into 13 main categories. Most of
                     the posts belong to categories of application development, configuration, and networking.
                     On the other hand, we find that the posts on monitoring status, transferring data,
                     and authenticating users are more popular among developers compared to the other topics.
                     Specifically, developers face challenges in web browser issues, networking error and
                     memory management. Besides, there is a lack of experts in this domain. Conclusion:
                     Our research findings will guide future work on the development of new tools and techniques,
                     helping the community to focus efforts and understand existing trade-offs on Docker
                     topics.

                  <p>Background: Third-party software libraries often serve as fundamental building blocks
                     for developing applications. However, depending on such libraries for development
                     raises a new concern, energy consumption, which has become of increased interest for
                     the software engineering community in recent years. Understanding the energy implications
                     of software design choices is an ongoing research challenge, especially when working
                     with mobile devices that are constrained by limited battery life. Aims: Our goal is
                     to research approaches, which will support software developers to better comprehend
                     the energy implications of software design choices on Android. For this study, we
                     particularly focus on APIs from third-party libraries for which we research methods
                     that will enable estimating the energy consumption without the need for specific measurement
                     hardware and laborious measurements. Method: To achieve the stipulated goal we introduce
                     System API Utilization Profiles (uAPI) which are based on the general assumption that
                     the actual energy consumption of a library is directly tied to its utilization of
                     the underlying System API. We provide a formal definition and implementation of the
                     proposed uAPI profiles that are calculated based on dynamic call graphs obtained from
                     a library under test. To further show the connection between our proposed uAPI profiles
                     and energy consumption, we empirically examined their correlation using two experiments.
                     The first one is dedicated to Android I/O operations, the second one examines uAPI
                     profiles based on a popular open-source library for JSON document processing. Results:
                     In our empirical evaluation, we collected 1052 individual call graphs which we used
                     as an input to evaluate the our model and compare it with the actual energy consumption
                     measured. For each call graph, we measured the energy consumption with special hardware
                     and attributed the measurements to individual methods. Based on that data, we examined
                     a strong linear correlation between the proposed uAPI profiles and the actual measured
                     energy consumption. Conclusions: uApi profiles serve as a lightweight and feasible
                     approach to characterize the energy characteristics of third-party libraries. Their
                     computation does not involve any special hardware, and there are no alterations on
                     the target mobile device required. For future work, we investigate possibilities to
                     use the proposed uAPI profiles as a foundation for a regression model, which would
                     allow us to predict the energy consumption development of a library over time.

                  <p>Background: Medical device development projects must follow proper directives and
                     regulations to be able to market and sell the end-product in their respective territories.
                     The regulations describe requirements that seem to be opposite to efficient software
                     development and short time-to-market. As agile approaches, like DevOps, are becoming
                     more and more popular in software industry, a discrepancy between these modern methods
                     and traditional regulated development has been reported. Although examples of successful
                     adoption in this context exist, the research is sparse. Aims: The objective of this
                     study is twofold: to review the current state of DevOps adoption in regulated medical
                     device environment; and to propose a checklist based on that review for introducing
                     DevOps in that context. Method: A multivocal literature review is performed and evidence
                     is synthesized from sources published between 2015 to March of 2020 to capture the
                     opinions of experts and community in this field. Results: Our findings reveal that
                     adoption of DevOps in a regulated medical device environment such as ISO 13485 has
                     its challenges, but potential benefits may outweigh those in areas such as regulatory,
                     compliance, security, organizational and technical. Conclusion: DevOps for regulated
                     medical device environments is a highly appealing approach as compared to traditional
                     methods and could be particularly suited for regulated medical development. However,
                     an organization must properly anchor a transition to DevOps in top-level management
                     and be supportive in the initial phase utilizing professional coaching and space for
                     iterative learning; as such an initiative is a complex organizational and technical
                     task.

                  <p>Background: Program similarity is a fundamental concept, central to the solution of
                     software engineering tasks such as software plagiarism, clone identification, code
                     refactoring and code search. Accurate similarity estimation between programs requires
                     an in-depth understanding of their structure, semantics and flow. A control flow graph
                     (CFG), is a graphical representation of a program which captures its logical control
                     flow and hence its semantics. A common approach is to estimate program similarity
                     by analysing CFGs using graph similarity measures, e.g. graph edit distance (GED).
                     However, graph edit distance is an NP-hard problem and computationally expensive,
                     making the application of graph similarity techniques to complex software programs
                     impractical. Aim: This study intends to examine the effectiveness of graph neural
                     networks to estimate program similarity, by analysing the associated control flow
                     graphs. Method: We introduce funcGNN1, which is a graph neural network trained on
                     labeled CFG pairs to predict the GED between unseen program pairs by utilizing an
                     effective embedding vector. To our knowledge, this is the first time graph neural
                     networks have been applied on labeled CFGs for estimating the similarity between highlevel
                     language programs. Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness of funcGNN to estimate
                     the GED between programs and our experimental analysis demonstrates how it achieves
                     a lower error rate (1.94 x10-3), with faster (23 times faster than the quickest traditional
                     GED approximation method) and better scalability compared with state of the art methods.
                     Conclusion: funcGNN posses the inductive learning ability to infer program structure
                     and generalise to unseen programs. The graph embedding of a program proposed by our
                     methodology could be applied to several related software engineering problems (such
                     as code plagiarism and clone identification) thus opening multiple research directions.

                  <p>Background: Pull request (PR) based development, which is a norm for the social coding
                     platforms, entails the challenge of evaluating the contributions of, often unfamiliar,
                     developers from across the open source ecosystem and, conversely, submitting a contribution
                     to a project with unfamiliar maintainers. Previous studies suggest that the decision
                     of accepting or rejecting a PR may be influenced by a diverging set of technical and
                     social factors, but often focus on relatively few projects, do not consider ecosystem-wide
                     measures, or the possible non-monotonic relationships between the predictors and PR
                     acceptance probability. Aim: We aim to shed light on this important decision making
                     process by testing which measures significantly affect the probability of PR acceptance
                     on a significant fraction of a large ecosystem, rank them by their relative importance
                     in predicting PR acceptance, and determine the shape of the functions that map each
                     predictor to PR acceptance. Method: We proposed seven hypotheses regarding which technical
                     and social factors might affect PR acceptance and created 17 measures based on them.
                     Our dataset consisted of 470,925 PRs from 3349 popular NPM packages and 79,128 GitHub
                     users who created those. We tested which of the measures affect PR acceptance and
                     ranked the significant measures by their importance in a predictive model. Results:
                     Our predictive model had and AUC of 0.94, and 15 of the 17 measures were found to
                     matter, including five novel ecosystem-wide measures. Measures describing the number
                     of PRs submitted to a repository and what fraction of those get accepted, and signals
                     about the PR review phase were most significant. We also discovered that only four
                     predictors have a linear influence on the PR acceptance probability while others showed
                     a more complicated response. Conclusion: Our findings should be helpful for PR creators,
                     integrators, as well as tool designers to focus on the important factors affecting
                     PR acceptance.

                     We then perform a feature importance analysis to understand the relative importance
                     of each individual feature and groups thereof.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: Through a case study of eight popular apps, we show patterns in developers'
                     response behavior. Our results demonstrate not only that rating and review length
                     are among the most important but also that review posted time, sentiment, and the
                     writing style play an important role in the response prediction. Additionally, the
                     variation in feature importance ranking implies that different app developers use
                     different feature weights when prioritizing responses.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: Our results may provide guidance for those building review or response
                     prioritization tools and developers wishing to prioritize their responses effectively.

                  <p>Background: A consistent body of research and practice have identified that technical
                     debt provides valuable and actionable insight into the design and implementation deficiencies
                     of complex software systems. Existing software tools enable characterizing and measuring
                     the amount of technical debt at selective granularity levels; by providing a computational
                     model, they enable stakeholders to measure and ultimately control this phenomenon.
                     Aims: In this paper we aim to study the evolution and characteristics of technical
                     debt in open-source software. For this, we carry out a longitudinal study that covers
                     the entire development history of several complex applications. The goal is to improve
                     our understanding of how the amount and composition of technical debt changes in evolving
                     software. We also study how new technical debt is introduced in software, as well
                     as identify how developers handle its accumulation over the long term. Method: We
                     carried out our evaluation using three complex, open-source Java applications. All
                     110 released versions, covering more than 10 years of development history for each
                     application were analyzed using SonarQube. We studied how the amount, composition
                     and history of technical debt changed during development, compared our results across
                     the studied applications and present our most important findings. Results: For each
                     application, we identified key versions during which large amounts of technical debt
                     were added, removed or both. This had significantly more impact when compared to the
                     lines of code or class count increases that generally occurred during development.
                     However, within each version, we found high correlation between file lines of code
                     and technical debt. We observed that the Pareto principle was satisfied for the studied
                     applications, as 20% of issue types generated around 80% of total technical debt.
                     Interestingly, there was a large degree of overlap between the issues that generated
                     most of the debt across the studied applications. Conclusions: Early application versions
                     showed greater fluctuation in the amount of existing technical debt. We found application
                     size to be an unreliable predictor for the quantity of technical debt. Most debt was
                     introduced in applications as part of milestone releases that expanded their feature
                     set; likewise, we identified releases where extensive refactoring significantly reduced
                     the level of debt. We also discovered that technical debt issues persist for a long
                     time in source code, and their removal did not appear to be prioritized according
                     to type or severity.

                  <p>Background. As software took control over hardware in many domains, the question of
                     the energy footprint induced by the software is becoming critical for our society,
                     as the resources powering the underlying infrastructure are finite. Yet, beyond this
                     growing interest, energy consumption remains a difficult concept to master for a developer.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims. The purpose of this study is to better understand the root causes that prevent
                     the issue of software energy consumption to be more widely considered by developers
                     and companies.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method. To investigate this issue, this paper reports on a qualitative study we conducted
                     in an industrial context. We applied an in-depth analysis of the interviews of 10
                     experienced developers and summarized a set of implications.

                  <p>Results. We argue that our study delivers i) insightful feedback on how green software
                     design is considered among the interviewed developers and ii) a set of findings to
                     build helpful tools, motivate further research, and establish better development strategies

                  <p>Conclusion. This paper covers an industrial case study of developers' awareness of
                     green software design and how to promote it within the company. While it might not
                     be generalizable for any company, we believe our results deliver a common body of
                     knowledge with implications to be considered for similar cases and further researches.

                  <p>Background: Google announced Kotlin as an Android official programming language in
                     2017, giving developers an option of writing applications using a language that combines
                     object-oriented and functional features. Aims: The goal of this work is to understand
                     the usage of Kotlin features considering four aspects: i) which features are adopted,
                     ii) what is the degree of adoption, iii) when are these features added into Android
                     applications for the first time, and iv) how the usage of features evolves along with
                     applications' evolution. Method: Exploring the source code of 387 Android applications,
                     we identify the usage of Kotlin features on each version application's version and
                     compute the moment that each feature is used for the first time. Finally, we identify
                     the evolution trend that better describes the usage of these features. Results: 15
                     out of 26 features are used on at least 50% of applications. Moreover, we found that
                     type inference, lambda and safe call are the most used features. Also, we observed
                     that the most used Kotlin features are those first included on Android applications.
                     Finally, we report that the majority of applications tend to add more instances of
                     24 out of 26 features along with their evolution. Conclusions: Our study generates
                     7 main findings. We present their implications, which are addressed to developers,
                     researchers and tool builders in order to foster the use of Kotlin features to develop
                     Android applications.

                  <p>Context: Many software systems are highly configurable. Different configuration options
                     could lead to varying performances of the system. It is difficult to measure system
                     performance in the presence of an exponential number of possible combinations of these
                     options.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Goal: Predicting software performance by using a small configuration sample.</p> 
                  <p>Method: This paper proposes Perf-AL to address this problem via adversarial learning.
                     Specifically, we use a generative network combined with several different regularization
                     techniques (L1 regularization, L2 regularization and a dropout technique) to output
                     predicted values as close to the ground truth labels as possible. With the use of
                     adversarial learning, our network identifies and distinguishes the predicted values
                     of the generator network from the ground truth value distribution. The generator and
                     the discriminator compete with each other by refining the prediction model iteratively
                     until its predicted values converge towards the ground truth distribution.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: We argue that (i) the proposed method can achieve the same level of prediction
                     accuracy, but with a smaller number of training samples. (ii) Our proposed model using
                     seven real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
                     methods. This help to further promote software configurable performance.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusion: Experimental results on seven public real-world datasets demonstrate that
                     PERF-AL outperforms state-of-the-art software performance prediction methods.

                  <p>Background: Given the invisibility and unpredictability of distributed crowdtesting
                     processes, there is a large number of duplicate reports, and detecting these duplicate
                     reports is an important task to help save testing effort. Although, many approaches
                     have been proposed to automatically detect the duplicates, the comparison among them
                     and the practical guidelines to adopt these approaches in crowdtesting remain vague.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: We aim at conducting the first experimental evaluation of the commonly-used
                     and state-of-the-art approaches for duplicate detection in crowdtesting reports, and
                     exploring which is the golden approach.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: We begin with a systematic review of approaches for duplicate detection, and
                     select ten state-of-the-art approaches for our experimental evaluation. We conduct
                     duplicate detection with each approach on 414 crowdtesting projects with 59,289 reports
                     collected from one of the largest crowdtesting platforms.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: Machine learning based approach, i.e., ML-REP, and deep learning based approach,
                     i.e., DL-BiMPM, are the best two approaches for duplicate reports detection in crowdtesting,
                     while the later one is more sensitive to the size of training data and more time-consuming
                     for model training and prediction.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: This paper provides new insights and guidelines to select appropriate
                     duplicate detection techniques for duplicate crowdtesting reports detection.

                  <p>Background: Continuous Engineering practices are increasingly adopted in modern software
                     development. However, a frequently reported need is for more effective methods to
                     analyze the massive amounts of data resulting from the numerous build and test runs.
                     Aims: We present and evaluate Spectrum-Based Log Diagnosis (SBLD), a method to help
                     developers quickly diagnose problems found in complex integration and deployment runs.
                     Inspired by Spectrum-Based Fault Localization, SBLD leverages the differences in event
                     occurrences between logs for failing and passing runs, to highlight events that are
                     stronger associated with failing runs.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: Using data provided by Cisco Norway, we empirically investigate the following
                     questions: (i) How well does SBLD reduce the effort needed to identify all failure-relevant
                     events in the log for a failing run? (ii) How is the performance of SBLD affected
                     by available data? (iii) How does SBLD compare to searching for simple textual patterns
                     that often occur in failure-relevant events? We answer (i) and (ii) using summary
                     statistics and heatmap visualizations, and for (iii) we compare three configurations
                     of SBLD (with resp. minimum, median and maximum data) against a textual search using
                     Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and the Vargha-Delaney measure of stochastic superiority.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: Our evaluation shows that (i) SBLD achieves a significant effort reduction
                     for the dataset used, (ii) SBLD benefits from additional logs for passing runs in
                     general, and it benefits from additional logs for failing runs when there is a proportional
                     amount of logs for passing runs in the data. Finally, (iii) SBLD and textual search
                     are roughly equally effective at effort-reduction, while textual search has slightly
                     better recall. We investigate the cause, and discuss how it is due to characteristics
                     of a specific part of our data.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: We conclude that SBLD shows promise as a method for diagnosing failing
                     runs, that its performance is positively affected by additional data, but that it
                     does not outperform textual search on the dataset considered. Future work includes
                     investigating SBLD's generalizability on additional datasets.

                  <p>Context: The success of software crowdsourcing depends on steady pools of task demand
                     and active workers supply. Existing analysis reveals an average task failure ratio
                     of 15.7% in software crowdsourcing market.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Goal: The objective of this study is to empirically investigate patterns and effect
                     of task diversity in software crowdsourcing platform in order to improve the success
                     and efficiency of software crowdsourcing.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: We first propose a conceptual task diversity model, and develop an approach
                     to measuring and analyzing task diversity. More specifically, task diversity is characterized
                     based on semantic similarity, dynamic competition level, and the analysis includes
                     identifying the dominant attributes distinguishing the competition levels, and measuring
                     the impact of task diversity on task success and worker performance in crowdsourcing
                     platform. The empirical study is conducted on more than one year's real-world data
                     from TopCoder, one of the leading software crowdsourcing platforms.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: We identified that monetary prize and task complexity are the dominant attributes
                     that differentiate among different competition levels. Based on these dominant attributes,
                     we concluded three task diversity patterns (configurations) from workers behavior
                     perspective: responsive-to-prize, responsive-to-prize-and-complexity and over-responsive-to-prize.
                     This study supports that the second pattern, i.e. responsive-to-prize-and-complexity
                     configuration, associates with the lowest task failure ratio.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: These findings are helpful for task requesters to plan for and improve
                     task success in a more effective and efficient manner in software crowdsourcing platform.

                  <p>Background: Teamwork is central component of any software development organization.
                     Therefore, the assessment of teamwork quality is important for team management in
                     practice. TWQ (Teamwork Quality) is a measure of the quality of intra-team interactions
                     developed specifically for software development teams. Aims: To perform a differentiated
                     replication of previous studies on TWQ to expand the contexts in which TWQ has been
                     applied, to refine the measurement instrument, increasing its reliability and validity,
                     and to identify possibilities for future research on software teams. Method: We performed
                     a cross-sectional survey collecting data from all 18 teams in one single software
                     organization and from all members of each team, totaling 123 participants. Results:
                     First, we refined the measurement instrument, achieving a more reliable and parsimonious
                     instrument. Second, our results confirmed findings from previous studies when individual
                     level data was used, but almost no confirmation was found when data was aggregated
                     at team level. Conclusions: Our results partially supported previous studies but raised
                     questions about the validity of the aggregation of individual data to team level measures
                     of the studied constructs.

                  <p>Background: In the context of software development, GitHub has been at the forefront
                     of platforms to store, analyze and maintain a large number of software repositories.
                     Topics have been introduced by GitHub as an effective method to annotate stored repositories.
                     However, labeling GitHub repositories should be carefully conducted to avoid adverse
                     effects on project popularity and reachability. Aims: We present TopFilter, a novel
                     approach to assist open source software developers in selecting suitable topics for
                     GitHub repositories being created. Method: We built a project-topic matrix and applied
                     a syntactic-based similarity function to recommend missing topics by representing
                     repositories and related topics in a graph. The ten-fold cross-validation methodology
                     has been used to assess the performance of TopFilter by considering different metrics,
                     i.e., success rate, precision, recall, and catalog coverage. Result: The results show
                     that TopFilter recommends good topics depending on different factors, i.e., collaborative
                     filtering settings, considered datasets, and pre-processing activities. Moreover,
                     TopFilter can be combined with a state-of-the-art topic recommender system (i.e.,
                     MNB network) to improve the overall prediction performance. Conclusion: Our results
                     confirm that collaborative filtering techniques can successfully be used to provide
                     relevant topics for GitHub repositories. Moreover, TopFilter can gain a significant
                     boost in prediction performances by employing the outcomes obtained by the MNB network
                     as its initial set of topics.

                  <p>Background: In model-based test generation, SMT solvers explore the state-space of
                     the model in search of violations of specified properties. If the solver finds that
                     a predicate can be violated, it produces a partial test specification demonstrating
                     the violation.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: The choice of solvers is important, as each may produce differing counterexamples.
                     We aim to understand how solver choice impacts the effectiveness of generated test
                     suites at finding faults.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: We have performed experiments examining the impact of solver choice across
                     multiple dimensions, examining the ability to attain goal satisfaction and fault detection
                     when satisfaction is achieved---varying the source of test goals, data types of model
                     input, and test oracle.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: The results of our experiment show that solvers vary in their ability to
                     produce counterexamples, and---for models where all solvers achieve goal satisfaction---in
                     the resulting fault detection of the generated test suites. The choice of solver has
                     an impact on the resulting test suite, regardless of the oracle, model structure,
                     or source of testing goals.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: The results of this study identify factors that impact fault-detection
                     effectiveness, and advice that could improve future approaches to model-based test
                     generation.

                  <p>Background: Functional size measures of software are widely used for effort estimation,
                     because they provide a fairly objective quantification of software size, which is
                     one of the main factors affecting software development effort. Unfortunately, in some
                     conditions, performing the standard Function Point Analysis process may be too long
                     and expensive. Moreover, functional measures could be needed before functional requirements
                     have been elicited completely and at the required detail level. Aim: Basing effort
                     estimation on measures that are simpler than Function Points---hence, faster and cheaper
                     to obtain---could be beneficial, if good estimation accuracy is possible. In this
                     paper, the level of accuracy that can be obtained using simple measures instead of
                     Function Points---as defined by IFPUG, the International Function Point User Group---is
                     evaluated, based on an empirical study. Method: An analysis of the data provided in
                     the ISBSG dataset was performed. Effort models based on standard IFPUG Function Points
                     and on the number of transactions were derived. The accuracy of the effort estimates
                     delivered by the two models were then compared. Results: Effort models based on the
                     number of transactions appear marginally less accurate than models based on standard
                     IFPUG Function Points for new development projects, and marginally more accurate for
                     projects extending previously developed software. Conclusions: Based on the results
                     of the empirical study, it seems that using the number of transactions instead of
                     the standard IFPUG Function Points measures does not cause estimate accuracy to change
                     to a practically appreciable extent. This conclusion applies to effort models using
                     size measure as the only independent variable. Additional research is necessary to
                     evaluate the performance of effort models based on the number of transactions in combination
                     with other factors.

                  <p>[Background] Publications on the professional occupation of Requirements Engineering
                     (RE) reported on market demands for both RE and non-RE qualifications and indicated
                     the state-of-the-practice of RE roles in industry. However, prior research was not
                     from the perspective of the RE area in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
                     (SWEBOK). Nor, they shed light on the industry needs of RE professionals in China.
                     [Aims] This paper focused on RE-specific tasks and skills sought after in China, from
                     the perspective of RE activities elaborated in SWEBOK. [Method] Using an empirical
                     qualitative research method, we selected and analyzed 535 job ads from China's two
                     largest job portals. Job titles and descriptions of these ads were analyzed to uncover
                     RErelevant responsibilities in the categories of RE activities in SWEBOK as well as
                     RE skills. [Results] We identified the qualifications, experience and skills demanded
                     by Chinese employers. Specifically, we reported 23 RE tasks demanded in the 535 job
                     ads, from the perspective of SWEBOK RE activities. [Conclusion] Our findings reveal
                     that in China's job market, 'requirements engineer' is explicitly used as a title
                     of job ads. Plus, around 78% of the selected job positions want the employees to perform
                     tasks in requirements elicitation. Editing requirements specification is the most
                     in-demand task in RE activities. In addition, employers placed more emphasis on both
                     RE-specific and broad industry experience.

                  <p>[Background] Recent investigations into the effects of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
                     have been contradictory and inconclusive. This hinders development teams to use research
                     results as the basis for deciding whether and how to apply TDD. [Aim] To support researchers
                     when designing a new study and to increase the applicability of TDD research in the
                     decision-making process in industrial context, we aim at identifying the reasons behind
                     the inconclusive research results in TDD. [Method] We studied the state of the art
                     in TDD research published in top venues in the past decade, and analyzed the way these

                  <p>Background. The effect of gender diversity in open source communities has gained increasing
                     attention from practitioners and researchers. For instance, organizations such as
                     the Python Software Foundation and the OpenStack Foundation started actions to increase
                     gender diversity and promote women to top positions in the communities. Problem. Although
                     the general underrepresentation of women (a.k.a. horizontal segregation) in open source
                     communities has been explored in a number of research studies, little is known about
                     the vertical segregation in open source communities---which occurs when there are
                     fewer women in high level positions. Aims. To address this research gap, in this paper
                     we present the results of a mixed-methods study on gender diversity and work practices
                     of core developers contributing to open-source communities. Method. In the first study,
                     we used mining-software repositories procedures to identify the core developers of
                     711 open source projects, in order to understand how common are women core developers
                     in open source communities and characterize their work practices. In the second study,
                     we surveyed the women core developers we identified in the first study to collect
                     their perceptions of gender diversity and gender bias they might have observed while
                     contributing to open source systems. Results. Our findings show that open source communities
                     present both horizontal and vertical segregation (only 2.3% of the core developers
                     are women). Nevertheless, differently from previous studies, most of the women core
                     developers (65.7%) report never having experienced gender discrimination when contributing
                     to an open source project. Finally, we did not note substantial differences between
                     the work practices among women and men core developers. Conclusions. We reflect on
                     these findings and present some ideas that might increase the participation of women
                     in open source communities.

                  <p>Background: Software engineering work and its context often has characteristics of
                     what in social science is termed 'messy'; it has ephemeral and irregular qualities.
                     This puts high demands on researchers doing inquiry and analysis. Aims: This paper
                     aims to show what a combination of situational analysis (SA) and narrative analysis
                     (NA) can bring to qualitative software engineering research, and in particular for
                     situations characterised by mess. Method: SA and NA were applied to a case study on
                     software security. Results: We found that these analysis methods helped us gain new
                     insights and understandings and a broader perspective of the situation we are studying.
                     Additionally, the methods helped collaboration in the analysis. Conclusion: We recommend
                     applying and studying these and similar combinations of analysis approaches further.

                  <p>Background: Measuring an organization's capability to innovate and assessing its innovation
                     output and performance is a challenging task. Previously, a comprehensive model and
                     a suite of measurements to support this task were proposed. Aims: In the current paper,
                     seven years since the publication of the paper titled Towards innovation measurement
                     in the software industry, we have reflected on the impact of the work. Method: We
                     have mainly relied on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the citations of the
                     paper using an established classification schema. Results: We found that the article
                     has had a significant scientific impact (indicated by the number of citations), i.e.,
                     (1) cited in literature from both software engineering and other fields, (2) cited
                     in grey literature and peer-reviewed literature, and (3) substantial citations in
                     literature not published in the English language. However, we consider a majority
                     of the citations in the peer-reviewed literature (75 out of 116) as neutral, i.e.,
                     they have not used the innovation measurement paper in any substantial way. All in
                     all, 38 out of 116 have used, modified or based their work on the definitions, measurements
                     or the model proposed in the article. This analysis revealed a significant weakness
                     of the citing work, i.e., among the citing papers, we found only two explicit comparisons
                     to the innovation measurement proposal, and we found no papers that identify weaknesses
                     of said proposal. Conclusions: This work highlights the need for being cautious of
                     relying solely on the number of citations for understanding impact, and the need for
                     further improving and supporting the peer-review process to identify unwarranted citations
                     in papers.

                  <p>Background. Testing is an essential activity in the software development life cycle.
                     Nowadays, testing activities are widely spread along the software development process,
                     since software products are continuously tested to meet the user's expectations and
                     to compete in global markets. In this context, internationalization testing is defined
                     as the practice focused on determining that a software works properly in a specific
                     language and in a particular region. Aims. This study aims to explore the particularities
                     of internationalization testing in the software industry and discuss the importance
                     of this practice from the point of view of professionals working in this context.
                     Method. We developed an exploratory qualitative study and conducted interviews with
                     professionals from an international software company, in order to understand three
                     aspects of internationalization testing: general characteristics and importance of
                     this practice, particularities of the process, and the role of test automation in
                     this context. Results. An amount of 13 professionals participated in this study. Results
                     demonstrated that internationalization testing is mostly related to aspects of graphical
                     user interfaces. In this context, truncation and mistranslations are the main faults
                     observed, and test automation might be difficult to implement and maintain due to
                     amount validations that are human-dependent. Conclusion. Internationalization testing
                     is an important practice to guarantee the quality of software products developed for
                     global markets. However, this aspect of software testing remains unpopular or unfamiliar
                     among professionals. This study is a step forward in the process of informing and
                     enlightening academic researchers and practitioners in industry about this theme.

                  <p>Background. Software engineering is one of the engineering fields with the highest
                     inflow of junior engineers. Tools that utilize source code analysis to provide feedback
                     on internal software quality, i.e. Technical Debt (TD), are valuable to junior developers
                     who can learn and improve their coding skills with minimal consultations with senior
                     colleagues. Objective. We aim at understating which SonarQube TD items junior developers
                     prioritize during the refactoring and how long they take to refactor them. Method.
                     We designed a case study with replicated design and we conducted it with 185 junior
                     developers in two countries, that developed 23 projects with different programming
                     languages and architectures. Results. Junior developers focus homogeneously on different
                     types of TD items. Moreover, they can refactor items in a fraction of the estimated
                     time, never spending more than 50% of the time estimated by SonarQube. Conclusion.
                     Junior Developers appreciate the usage of SonarQube and considered as a useful tool.
                     Companies might ask junior developers to quickly clean their code.

                  <p>Background: Automated program repair and other bug-fixing approaches are gaining attention
                     in the software engineering community. Automation shows promise in reducing bug fixing
                     costs. However, many developers express reluctance about accepting machine-generated
                     patches into their codebases.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: To contribute to the scientific understanding and the empirical investigation
                     of human trust and perception with regards to automation in software maintenance.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: We design and conduct an eye-tracking study investigating how developers perceive
                     trust as a function of code provenance (i.e., author or source). We systematically
                     vary provenance while controlling for patch quality.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: In our study of ten participants, overall visual code scanning and the distribution
                     of attention differed across identical code patches labeled as human- vs. machine-written.
                     Participants looked more at the source code for human-labeled patches and looked more
                     at tests for machine-labeled patches. Participants judged human-labeled patches to
                     have better readability and coding style. However, participants were more comfortable
                     giving a critical task to an automated program repair tool.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusion: We find that there are significant differences in code review behavior
                     based on trust as a function of patch provenance. Further, we find that important
                     differences can be revealed by eye tracking. Our results may inform the subsequent
                     design and analysis of automated repair techniques to increase developers' trust and,
                     consequently, their deployment.

                  <p>Background: The number of Systematic Literature Reviews published in Software Engineering
                     has been increasing in recent years. Due to this fact, one point not addressed is
                     the possibility of plagiarism when dealing with SLRs, especially when dealing with
                     SLR maintenance (update) activities.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: To identify what researchers understand by SLR plagiarism, whether the process
                     of maintaining these SLRs can increase the chances of committing plagiarism, and how
                     this misconduct can be avoided.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: During a previous survey about SLR maintenance, we asked questions about SLR
                     plagiarism issues and also a semi-structured interviews was performed to obtain responses
                     from experts conducting SLRs on possible SLR maintenance plagiarism issues. Also,
                     a comparison between SLR updates and their original works was made, through a plagiarism
                     tool, looking for possible plagiarism situations.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: The general concern, in the survey and semi-structured interviews, is with
                     study proper citation and what was published by others. We understand, therefore,
                     plagiarism in SLR is not different from other areas of research. However, we have
                     specific situations for the SLR maintenance process that lead us to present a set
                     of good practices to avoid plagiarism. When comparing SLRs updates with their originals,
                     possible plagiarism situations were identified, mainly in the method section, which
                     was expected due to its reuse.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: Although we do not need a specific plagiarism definition for SLRs when
                     we think in SLR maintenance (update), we understand there is a higher possibility
                     of committing plagiarism without proper care, as identified in the comparisons made
                     between SLRs updates and their original versions.

                  <p>Objective. Propose the adoption of cohort studies in MSR research in particular and
                     empirical Software Engineering (SE) in general. Method. We run a preliminary literature
                     review to show the current state of the practice of cohort studies in SE. We explore
                     how cohort studies overcome the issues that prevent the identification of causality
                     in this type of non-experimental designs.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results. The basic mechanism used by cohort studies to try to obtain causality consists
                     of controlling potentially confounding variables. This is articulated by means of
                     different techniques.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusion. Cohort studies seem to be a promising approach to be used in MSR in particular
                     and SE in general.

                  <p>Background: Code smells indicate potential design or implementation problems that
                     may have a negative impact on programs. Similar to other software artefacts, developers
                     use Stack Overflow (SO) to ask questions about code smells. However, given the high
                     number of questions asked on the platform, and the limitations of the default tagging
                     system, it takes significant effort to extract knowledge about code smells by means
                     of manual approaches. Aim: We utilized supervised machine learning techniques to automatically
                     identify code-smell discussions from SO posts. Method: We conducted an experiment
                     using a manually labeled dataset that contains 3000 code-smell and 3000 non-code-smell
                     posts to evaluate the performance of different classifiers when automatically identifying
                     code smell discussions. Results: Our results show that Logistic Regression (LR) with
                     parameter C=20 (inverse of regularization strength) and Bag of Words (BoW) feature
                     extraction technique achieved the best performance amongst the algorithms we evaluated
                     with a precision of 0.978, a recall of 0.965, and an F1-score of 0.971. Conclusion:
                     Our results show that machine learning approach can effectively locate code-smell
                     posts even if posts' title and/or tags cannot be of help. The technique can be used
                     to extract code smell discussions from other textual artefacts (e.g., code reviews),
                     and promisingly to extract SO discussions of other topics.

                  <p>Background: Novel frameworks for the development of desktop applications with web
                     technologies have become popular. These desktop web app frameworks allow developers
                     to reuse existing code and knowledge of web applications for the creation of cross-platform
                     apps integrated with native APIs. Aims: To date, desktop web app frameworks have not
                     been studied empirically. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by characterizing
                     the usage of web frameworks and providing evidence on how beneficial are their pros
                     and how impactful are their cons. Method: We conducted an empirical study, collecting
                     and analyzing 453 desktop web apps publicly available on GitHub. We performed qualitative
                     and quantitative analyses to uncover the traits and issues of desktop web apps. Results:
                     We found that desktop web app frameworks enable the development of cross-platform
                     applications even for teams of limited dimensions, taking advantage of the abundant
                     number of available web libraries. However, at the same time, bugs deriving from platform
                     compatibility issues are common. Conclusions: Our study provides concrete evidence
                     on some disadvantages associated with desktop web app frameworks. Future work is required
                     to assess their impact on the required development and maintenance effort, and to
                     investigate other aspects not considered in this first research.

                  <p>Background. Regression testing is a practice that ensures a System Under Test (SUT)
                     still works as expected after changes. The simplest regression testing approach is
                     Retest-all, which consists of re-executing the entire Test Suite (TS) on the new version
                     of the SUT. When SUT and its TS grow in size, applying Retest-all could be expensive.
                     Test Suite Reduction (TSR) approaches would allow overcoming the above-mentioned issues
                     by reducing TSs while preserving their fault-detection capability.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aim. In this paper, we introduce GASSER (Genetic Algorithm for teSt SuitE Reduction),
                     a new approach for TSR based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, namely NSGA-II.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method. GASSER reduces TSs by maximizing statement coverage and diversity of test
                     cases, and by minimizing the size of the reduced TSs.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results. The preliminary study shows that GASSER reduces more the TS size with a small
                     effect on fault-detection capability when compared with traditional approaches.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions. These outcomes highlight the potential benefits of the use of multi-objective
                     evolutionary algorithm in TSR field and pose the basis for future work.

                  <p>Background: The unprecedented access to data has rendered a remarkable opportunity
                     to analyze, understand, and optimize the investigation approaches in almost all the
                     areas of (Empirical) Software Engineering. However, data analytics is time and effort
                     consuming, thus, expensive, and not automatically valuable.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Objective: This vision paper demonstrates that it is crucial to consider Return-on-Investment
                     (ROI) when performing Data Analytics. Decisions on "How much analytics is needed"?
                     are hard to answer. ROI could guide for decision support on the What?, How?, and How
                     Much? analytics for a given problem.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical studies
                     that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla Firefox project.
                     The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT against Naive Bayes and
                     Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency classification and (ii) Active
                     Learning against passive Learning (random sampling) for REQUIRES dependency extraction.
                     For both the cases, their analysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable
                     benefit from DA is predicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: For the first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest,
                     provided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second, Active
                     Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher ROI compared
                     to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the studies, estimate on,
                     How much analysis likely would pay off for the invested efforts?, was indicated by
                     the break-even point.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: Decisions for the depth and breadth of DA of empirical data should not
                     be made solely based on the accuracy measures. Since ROI-driven Data Analytics provides
                     a simple yet effective direction to discover when to stop further investigation while
                     considering the cost and value of the various types of analysis, it helps to avoid
                     over-analyzing empirical data.

                  <p>Background. C# maintains type safety and security by not allowing direct dangerous
                     pointer arithmetic. To improve performance for special cases, pointer arithmetic is
                     provided via an unsafe context. Programmers can use the C# unsafe keyword to encapsulate
                     a code block, which can use pointer arithmetic. In the Common Language Runtime (CLR),
                     unsafe code is referred to as unverifiable code. It then becomes the responsibility
                     of the programmer to ensure the encapsulated code snippet is not dangerous. Naturally,
                     this raises concern on whether such trust is misused by programmers when they promote
                     the use of C# unsafe context. Aim. We aim to analyze the prevalence and vulnerabilities
                     of share code examples using C# unsafe keyword in Stack Overflow (SO) code sharing
                     platform. Method. By using some regular expressions and manual checks, we extracted
                     C# unsafe code relevant posts from SO and categorized them into some software development
                     scenarios. Results. In the entire SO data dump of September 2018, we find 2,283 C#
                     snippets with the unsafe keyword. Among those posts, 27% of posts are about Image
                     processing, where unsafe codes are mainly used for performance reasons. The second
                     most popular category by 21% of the codes in the posts is used for 'Interoperability'
                     reasons. That is 'unsafe' is used to enable 'Interoperability' between C# managed
                     codes and unmanaged codes. The 'stackalloc' operator is the third category with 9%
                     of unsafe code posts. The stackalloc operator allocates a block of memory on the stack.
                     Since C# 7.2, Microsoft recommends against using 'stackalloc' in unsafe context whenever
                     possible. Manual inspection shows 67 code snippets with dangerous functions that can
                     introduce vulnerability if not used with caution (e.g., buffer overflow). Finally,
                     35% of 'Interoperability' posts have 'P/Invoke' tag were used outside NativeMethods
                     class, which is in contrast to Microsoft design suggestion. Conclusion. Our study
                     leads to 7 main findings, and these findings show the importance of cautiously using
                     this feature.

                  <p>[Background] Previous research has shown that developers commonly misuse cryptography
                     APIs. [Aim] We have conducted an exploratory study to find out how crypto APIs are
                     used in open-source Java projects, what types of misuses exist, and why developers
                     make such mistakes. [Method] We used a static analysis tool to analyze hundreds of
                     open-source Java projects that rely on Java Cryptography Architecture, and manually
                     inspected half of the analysis results to assess the tool results. We also contacted
                     the maintainers of these projects by creating an issue on the GitHub repository of
                     each project, and discussed the misuses with developers. [Results] We learned that
                     85% of Cryptography APIs are misused, however, not every misuse has severe consequences.
                     Developer feedback showed that security caveats in the documentation of crypto APIs
                     are rare, developers may overlook misuses that originate in third-party code, and
                     the context where a Crypto API is used should be taken into account. [Conclusion]
                     We conclude that using Crypto APIs is still problematic for developers but blindly
                     blaming them for such misuses may lead to erroneous conclusions.

                  <p>Background: The artifacts used in Agile software testing and the reasons why these
                     artifacts are used are fairly well-understood. However, empirical research on how
                     Agile test artifacts are eventually designed in practice and which quality factors
                     make them useful for software testing remains sparse. Aims: Our objective is two-fold.
                     First, we identify current challenges in using test artifacts to understand why certain
                     quality factors are considered good or bad. Second, we build an Activity-Based Artifact
                     Quality Model that describes what Agile test artifacts should look like. Method: We
                     conduct an industrial survey with 18 practitioners from 12 companies operating in
                     seven different domains. Results: Our analysis reveals nine challenges and 16 factors
                     describing the quality of six test artifacts from the perspective of Agile testers.
                     Interestingly, we observed mostly challenges regarding language and traceability,
                     which are well-known to occur in non-Agile projects. Conclusions: Although Agile software
                     testing is becoming the norm, we still have little confidence about general do's and
                     don'ts going beyond conventional wisdom. This study is the first to distill a list
                     of quality factors deemed important to what can be considered as useful test artifacts.

                  <p>Background: Technical debt (TD) has been an important focus of attention in recent
                     years by the scientific community and the software industry. TD is a concept for expressing
                     the lack of internal software quality that directly affects its capacity to evolve.
                     Some studies have focused on the TD industry perspective. Aims: To characterize how
                     the software industry professionals in Uruguay understand, perceive, and adopt technical
                     debt management (TDM) activities. Method: To replicate a Brazilian survey with the
                     Uruguayan software industry and compare their findings. Results: From 259 respondents,
                     many indicated any awareness of the TD concept due to the faced difficult to realize
                     how to associate such a concept with actual software issues. Therefore, it is possible
                     to observe a considerable variability in the importance of TDM among the respondents.
                     However, a small part of the respondents declares to carry out TDM activities in their
                     organizations. A list of software technologies declared as used by practitioners was
                     produced and can be useful to support TDM activities. Conclusions: The TD concept
                     and its management are not common yet in Uruguay. There are indications of TD unawareness
                     and difficulties in the conduction of some TDM activities considered as very important
                     by the practitioners. There is a need for more effort aiming to disseminate the TD
                     knowledge and to provide software technologies to support the adoption of TDM in Uruguay.
                     It is likely other software engineering communities face similar issues. Therefore,
                     further investigations in these communities can be of interest.

                  <p>Background. Chaos Engineering is proposed as a practice to verify a system's resilience
                     under real, operational conditions. It employs fault injection, is originally developed
                     at Netflix, and supported by several tools from there and other sources. Aims. We
                     aim to introduce Chaos Engineering at ICA Gruppen AB, a group of companies whose core
                     business is grocery retail, to improve their systems' resilience, and to capture our
                     knowledge gained from literature and interviews in a process framework for the introduction
                     of Chaos Engineering. Method. The research is conducted under the design science paradigm,
                     where the problem is conceptualized through a literature study of Chaos Engineering
                     and exploratory interviews in the company. The solution framework is designed based
                     on the literature and a tool survey, and validated by letting software engineers at
                     ICA apply parts of it to the software systems of ica.se website, including its e-shop.
                     Results. The main contributions are a synthesis of Chaos Engineering literature and
                     tools, in depth understanding of the needs of the case company, and guidelines for
                     introducing Chaos Engineering. Conclusions. The applied parts were concluded to be
                     feasible and they successfully discovered a set of initial improvement opportunities
                     for the system's resilience, as well as a suitable Chaos Engineering practice for
                     future resilience testing of the system. We recommend companies using the framework
                     as a guide for the implementation of Chaos Engineering.
