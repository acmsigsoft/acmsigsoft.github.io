                  <p>Dynamic analysis can identify improvements to programs that cannot feasibly be identified
                     by static analysis; concurrency improvements are a motivating example. However, mapping
                     these dynamic-analysis-based improvements back to patch-like source-code changes is
                     non-trivial. We describe a system, Scopda, for generating source-code patches for
                     improvements identified by execution-trace-based dynamic analysis. Scopda uses a graph-based
                     static program representation (abstract program graph, APG), containing inter-procedural
                     control flow and local data flow information, to analyse and transform static source-code.
                     We demonstrate Scopda's ability to generate sensible source code patches for Java
                     programs, though it is fundamentally language agnostic.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a generic type system for Featherweight Java (FJ) that is parametrized
                     with a monad-like structure, and prove a uniform soundness theorem. Its instances
                     include some region type systems studied by Martin Hofmann et al. as well as a new
                     one that performs more precise analysis of trace-based properties. Their soundness
                     is guaranteed by the uniform theorem. We only need to verify some natural conditions.
                     Instead of refining the FJ type system as in the previous work, our region type system
                     is separate from the FJ type system, making it simpler and also easier to move to
                     larger fragments of Java. Moreover, the uniform framework helps to avoid redundant
                     work on the meta-theory when extending the system to cover other language features
                     such as exception handling.</p>

                     This is particularly true for concurrent programs. We describe and evaluate a system,
                     Rehype, which takes Java programs, performs low-overhead tracing of method calls,

                     and suggests source-code-oriented improvements. Rehype deals with task-based concurrency,
                     specifically a future-based model of tasks. Implementing the suggested improvements
                     on an industrial API server more than doubled request-processing throughput.</p>

                  <p>One of the main factors of the increasing power of deductive verification tools are
                     modern SMT solvers. Unfortunately, SMT solvers usually do not produce proof artifacts
                     that could be inspected or checked. KeY is a formal platform for the deductive verification
                     of Java programs which produces explicit, browsable proofs. SMT solvers can be driven
                     from within KeY, but this unfortunately breaks these proof transparency intentions.
                     </p> 
                  <p>In this paper, we describe how we complemented the existing translation of proof obligations
                     to Z3 (<em>There ...</em>) with the replay of proof transcripts reported by Z3 inside KeY (<em>... and Back Again</em>). We describe the conceptual and engineering challenges we encountered for this round
                     trip and present solutions for them. </p> 
                  <p>The replay technique has been implemented in KeY, and in the evaluation, we demonstrate
                     the feasibility of the approach for first-order proof instances and investigate the
                     effects of proof replay on the proof run time and size.</p>

                  <p>Java code can be annotated with formal specifications using the Java Modelling Language
                     (JML). Previous work has provided IDE plugins intended to help write JML, but mostly

                     a focus on ease of use and maintainability. Features such as syntax, semantic, and
                     type checking, as well as syntax highlighting and code completion are integrated into
                     the plugin. The plugin can also be extended in the future to add more features. The
                     source code for the plugin can be found at https://gitlab.utwente.nl/fmt/intellijml.</p>

                  <p>Using cryptographic APIs to encrypt and decrypt data, calculate digital signatures,
                     or compute hashes is error prone. Weak or unsupported cryptographic algorithms can
                     cause information leakage and runtime exceptions, such as a NoSuchAlgorithmException
                     in Java. Using the wrong cryptographic service provider can also lead to unsupported
                     cryptographic algorithms. Moreover, for Android developers who want to store their
                     key material in the Android Keystore, misused cryptographic algorithms and providers
                     make the key material unsafe. </p> 
                  <p> We present the Crypto Checker, a pluggable type system that detects the use of forbidden
                     algorithms and providers at compile time. For typechecked code, the Crypto Checker
                     guarantees that only trusted algorithms and providers are used, and thereby ensures
                     that the cryptographic APIs never cause runtime exceptions or use weak algorithms
                     or providers. The Crypto Checker is easy-to-use: it allows developers to determine
                     which algorithms and providers are permitted by writing specifications using type
                     qualifiers. </p> 
                  <p> We implemented the Crypto Checker for Java and evaluated it with 32 open-source Java
                     applications (over 2 million LOC). We found 2 issues that cause runtime exceptions
                     and 62 violations of security recommendations and best practices. We also used the
                     Crypto Checker to analyze 65 examples from a public benchmark of hard security issues
                     and discuss the differences between our approach and a different static analysis in
                     detail.</p>

                  <p>Mungo is an object-oriented language that uses typestates with a behavioural type
                     system to ensure the absence of null-dereferencing. Typestates are usages that specify
                     the admissible sequences of method calls on objects. Previous type systems for Mungo
                     have all had a linearity constraint on objects. We present an extension of these systems,
                     where usage specifications can now include a parallel construct that lets us describe
                     separate local behaviour. A parallel usage describes a separation of the heap, and
                     this allows us to reason about aliasing and to express arbitrary interleaving of local
                     protocols. This also solves the state-space explosion problem for usages. Our extension
                     retains the safety properties of previous type systems for Mungo.</p>

                     left behind by the developers. The European H2020 Project DECODER (https://www.decoder-
                     project.eu) addresses this problem by proposing to combine Natural Language Processing
                     techniques and Formal Methods to turn as best as possible code artifacts into formal
                     data allowing to reduce the maintenance costs and thus the total costs of ownership.
                     In this context, we will show how to generate JML annotations using a combination
                     of 1) automatic generation of minimal predicates, 2) Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                     based predicates generator, and 3) manual refinement and correction, to instrument
                     and enhance code and documentation. We will illustrate it on code samples from the
                     MyThaiStar (https://github.com/devonfw/my- thai-star) application developed with the
                     CASE tool devonfw by CAP GEMINI, and the Joram JMS implementation (https://gitlab.ow2.org/joram/joram)
                     from OW2 code base.</p>

                  <p>As the Java language evolves, the Java Modeling Language (JML) and the OpenJML deductive
                     verification tool must evolve with it. Changes in Java since Java 8 bring language
                     and organizational changes which affect the semantics of JML and the implementation
                     of OpenJML. They also raise questions about language definition, joint efforts, and
                     community engagement, some enumerated in this paper, for the Java formal reasoning
                     community to address.</p>
