                  <p>Active automata learning is a technique of querying black box systems and modelling
                     their behaviour. In this paper, we aim to apply active learning in parts. We formalise
                     the conditions on systems---with a decomposable set of actions---that make learning
                     in parts possible. The systems are themselves decomposable through non-intersecting
                     subsets of actions. Learning these subsystems/components requires less time and resources.
                     We prove that the technique works for both two components as well as an arbitrary
                     number of components. We illustrate the usefulness of this technique through a classical
                     example and through a real example from the industry.

                  <p>Isabelle/SACM is a tool for automated construction of model-based assurance cases
                     with integrated formal methods, based on the Isabelle proof assistant. Assurance cases
                     show how a system is safe to operate, through a human comprehensible argument demonstrating
                     that the requirements are satisfied, using evidence of various provenances. They are
                     usually required for certification of critical systems, often with evidence that originates
                     from formal methods. Automating assurance cases increases rigour, and helps with maintenance
                     and evolution. In this paper we apply Isabelle/SACM to a fragment of the assurance
                     case for an autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrator. We encode the metric unit
                     system (SI) in Isabelle, to allow modelling requirements and state spaces using physical
                     units. We develop a behavioural model in the graphical RoboChart state machine language,
                     embed the artifacts into Isabelle/SACM, and use it to demonstrate satisfaction of
                     the requirements.

                  <p>Formal methods used to validate software designs, like Alloy, OCL, and B, are powerful
                     tools to analyze complex structures (e.g., architectures, object-relational mappings)
                     captured as sets of relational constraints. However, their applicability is limited
                     when software is subject to uncertainty (derived, e.g., from lack of control over
                     third-party components, interaction with physical elements). In contrast, quantitative
                     verification has emerged as a powerful way of providing quantitative guarantees about
                     the performance, cost, and reliability of systems operating under uncertainty. However,
                     quantitative verification methods do not retain thefl exibility of relational modeling
                     in describing structures, forcing engineers to trade structural exploration for analytic
                     capabilities that concern probabilistic and other quantitative guarantees. This paper
                     contributes a method (HaiQ) that enhances structural modeling/synthesis with quantitative
                     guarantees in the style provided by quantitative verification. It includes a language
                     for describing structure and (stochastic) behavior of systems, and a temporal logic
                     that allows checking probability and reward-based properties over sets of feasible
                     design alternatives implicitly described by the relational constraints in a HaiQ model.
                     We report the results of applying a prototype tool in two domains, on which we show

                  <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are integrations of distributed computing systems with
                     physical processes that monitor and control entities in a physical environment. Although
                     the range of their applications include several critical domains, the current trend
                     is to verify CPSs with simulation-test systems rather than formal methodologies. In
                     this paper, we test the effectiveness of statistical model checking, within the Modest
                     Toolset, when analyzing the security of a non-trivial quadruple-tank water system
                     equipped with an ad-hoc intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of mitigating attacks.
                     Our goal is to evaluate the impact of three carefully chosen cyber-physical attacks,
                     i.e., attacks targeting sensors and/or actuators of the system with potential consequences
                     on the safety of the inner physical process. Our security analysis estimates both
                     the physical impact of the attacks and the performance of the proposed IDS.

                  <p>Many software applications contain confidential information, which has to be prevented
                     from leaking through unauthorized access. To enforce confidentiality, there are language-based
                     security mechanisms that rely on information flow control. Typically, these mechanisms
                     work post-hoc by checking whether confidential data is accessed unauthorizedly after
                     the complete program is written. The disadvantage is that incomplete programs cannot
                     be interpreted properly and information flow properties cannot be built in constructively.
                     In this work, we present a methodology to construct programs incrementally using refinement
                     rules to follow a lattice-based information flow policy. In every refinement step,
                     confidentiality and functional correctness of the program is guaranteed, such that
                     insecure programs are prohibited by construction. Our contribution is fourfold. We
                     formalize refinement rules for the constructive information flow control methodology,
                     prove soundness of the refinement rules, show that our approach is at least as expressive
                     as standard language-based mechanisms for information flow, and implement it in a
                     graphical editor called CorC. Our methodology is also usable for integrity properties,
                     which are dual to confidentiality.

                  <p>In the context of robotic software, the selection of an appropriate planner is one
                     of the most crucial software engineering decisions. Robot planners aim at computing
                     plans (i.e., blueprint of actions) to accomplish a complex mission. While many planners
                     have been proposed in the robotics literature, they are usually evaluated on showcase
                     examples, making hard to understand whether they can be effectively (re)used for realising
                     complex missions, with heterogeneous robots, and in real-world scenarios.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In this paper we propose ENFORCE, a framework which allows wrapping FM-based planners
                     into comprehensive software engineering tools, and considers complex robotic missions.
                     ENFORCE relies on (i) realistic maps (e.g, fire escape maps) that describe the environment
                     in which the robots are deployed; (ii) temporal logic for mission specification; and
                     (iii) Uppaal model checker to compute plans that satisfy mission specifications. We
                     evaluated ENFORCE by analyzing how it supports computing plans in real case scenarios,
                     and by evaluating the generated plans in simulated and real environments. The results
                     show that while ENFORCE is adequate for handling single-robot applications, the state
                     explosion still represents a major barrier for reusing existing planners in multi-robot
                     applications.

                  <p>A challenge that has gathered much attention in recent years is automated synthesis
                     of correct-by-construction software systems from declarative specifications. The specification
                     language is typically a subset of linear temporal logic called generalized reactivity
                     of rank 1, for which there exists an efficient synthesis algorithm. Specifications
                     in this language model the system as the interaction between an environment and a
                     controller, the former satisfying a set of assumptions and the latter a set of guarantees.
                     In order for a solution to exist, a sufficient set of assumptions implying the guarantees
                     must be provided. The assumptions must be as general as possible and small enough
                     to be intelligible by engineers that need to assess their consistency with the true
                     environment where the synthesized controller will operate.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The search for such assumptions is generally a refinement approach driven by counterstrategies,
                     characterizations of undesirable environment behaviors that force the violation of
                     the guarantees; assumptions are progressively refined in order to exclude such behaviors.
                     In this work we provide a heuristic to drive this counterstrategy-guided search towards
                     smaller refinements. We define a concept of minimality of refinements with respect
                     to counterstrategies and provide an algorithm that provably finds minimal refinements
                     with little time overhead. We show experimentally that it consistently produces one
                     or more shorter solutions than state of the art for a set of popular case studies.
                     We also demonstrate that in a popular case study (AMBA-AHB protocol) our heuristic
                     finds a close-to-optimal solution that cannot be found by previous fully automated
                     approaches.

                  <p>A wide range of interesting program properties are relational, i.e., they described
                     a relation between two program runs. Two prominent relational properties are the regression
                     verification (proving conditional program equivalence), and non-interference (proving
                     the absence of information flow).
                  </p> 
                  <p>The verification of relational properties is hardly accessible to engineers due to
                     the lack of appropriate specification languages for relational properties. In previous
                     work, we introduced the concept of generalized test tables: a table-based specification
                     language, which allows the tight temporal specification of functional (nonrelational)
                     properties for reactive systems.
                  </p> 
                  <p>We introduce relational test tables - an extension of generalized test tables for
                     the specification of relational properties. Relational test tables support specification
                     of k-safety properties (a super set of relational properties) between k â¥ 2 program
                     runs. We show the applicability of relational test tables by specifying and verifying
                     change scenarios and information flow of reactive systems. We provide an implementation
                     of the verification pipeline for programs following the IEC 61131-3 coding standard

                     by reformulating a classical combinatorics on words result, the Lemma of Levi. We
                     further enrich the induced rules by simplification steps based on results from the

                     existing successful string solvers, which are called based on several heuristics.
                     The experimental evaluation we performed shows that integrating our technique as an

                  <p>Industrial control systems are moving from isolated to distributed and cloud-connected
                     architectures. While the operational benefits of this migration form the driving force
                     for this trend, the necessary security assurance is often difficult to achieve. Formal
                     methods, including model checking, provide capable technologies to deal with this
                     challenge. However, when formal verification must account for the complexity of modern
                     control systems the state space being explored grows drastically as more details are
                     included in the analysis. This may eventually cause a state space explosion, which
                     makes formal verification infeasible. To address this, we propose a method for decomposing
                     cloud-connected control systems into modules representing the different parts of the
                     system (clients, the cloud, the control network, etc.). Based on the decomposed version
                     of the system, we use UPPAAL to model several well-known cyber attacks and formally
                     verify the system's behavior under these attacks. To determine viability of our approach,
                     we first use statistical model checking SMC to assess the probabilities of success
                     for selected attacks. Based on SMC outcomes, we use symbolic model checking to individually
                     analyse the sub-system affected by each attack. The results obtained from this analysis
                     are then used to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. We demonstrate our method
                     using an actual control system architecture provided by our industrial partner.

                  <p>Software smells have negative impacts on the reliability and modifiability of software
                     systems. The smells in architecture design can be cascaded down to the implementation
                     level and cause issues that require much effort to fix. Therefore, early detection
                     of the architecture smells can benefit the overall quality of the software system.
                     This paper presents an integration of methods that formally define the software architecture
                     design towards architecture smell detection. Our approach serves as a framework that
                     allows the architectural structures and behaviours to be formally analysed based on
                     a coherent technique. We evaluated the accuracy and performance of our approach with
                     the models generated from open source projects. The results show that our approach
                     is effective and functions well.

                  <p>Adoption of new digital technologies is impacting all aspects of society. While these
                     new technologies are accepted rapidly within the consumer segment, in the area of
                     industrial control systems the pace of change in computing is slower. This is often
                     due to the criticality and security constraints of such systems, since degraded or
                     hijacked control could lead to injuries or competitive disadvantages. Nowadays a critical
                     component of control systems is the key management protocol for protecting communication.
                     This is specifically important as more and more devices become part of industrial
                     control networks. The key management system must be reliable and robust in order to
                     ensure stable operation of the system with minimum downtime. This often means that
                     the system needs to be autonomous and dynamic, capable of periodically changing the
                     keys automatically and authenticating the system components. Different techniques
                     have been used to examine the reliability and robustness of the key management systems,
                     one promising approach is by using formal methods. In this paper we present a formally
                     verified key management system for use within distributed industrial control systems.
                     We demonstrate that the key management system can reliably handle authentication/communication
                     operations in real-time as well as joining/leaving of control units within the system.
                     We use UPPAAL to analyse several security properties, showing that our models satisfy
                     a collection of requirements defined by our industrial partner and are viable for
                     dynamic key management applications.

                  <p>UML models are standard artifacts used by software engineers for designing software.
                     As software is designed, different UML diagram types (e.g., class diagrams and sequence
                     diagrams) are produced by software designers. Since the various UML diagram types
                     describe different aspects of a software system, they are not independent but strongly
                     depend on each other, hence they must be consistent. Inconsistencies cause faults
                     in thefi nal software systems. It is, therefore, paramount that they get detected,
                     analyzed, andfi xed. Consistency rules are a useful tool proposed in the literature
                     to detect inconsistencies. They categorize constraints that help in identifying inconsistencies
                     when violated. This case study aims at collecting and analyzing UML models with OCL
                     consistency rules proposed in the literature and at promoting the development of a
                     reference benchmark that can be reused by the (FM-)research community. We collected
                     33 UML consistency rules and 206 different UML diagrams contained in 34 open-source
                     UML models presented in the literature. We propose an FM-based encoding of the consistency
                     rules in OCL. This encoding allows analyzing whether the consistency rules are satisfied
                     or violated within the 34 UML models. To assess the proposed benchmark, we analyzed
                     how the UML models, consistency rules, diagram types contained in the benchmark help
                     in assessing the consistency of UML models, and the consistency of diagrams across
                     the different software development phases. Our results show that the considered UML
                     models and consistency rules allowed identifying 2731 inconsistencies and that those
                     inconsistencies refer to different software development phases. We concluded that
                     the considered UML models and consistency rules could be considered as an initial
                     benchmark that can be further extended by the research community.

                  <p>In a distributed scenario it is possible to find systems consisting of independent
                     parties that collaboratively execute a business process, but cannot disclose a subset
                     of the data used in this process to each other. Such systems can be modelled using
                     the PE-BPMN notation: a privacy-enhanced extension of the BPMN process modeling notation.
                     Given a PE-BPMN model, we address the problem of verifying that the content of certain
                     data objects is not leaked to unauthorized parties. To this end, we formalise the
                     semantics of PE-BPMN collaboration diagrams via a translation into process algebraic
                     specifications. This formalisation enables us to apply model checking to detect unintended
                     data leakages in a PE-BPMN model. We specifically consider data leakages in the context
                     of secret sharing technology. The approach has been implemented on top of the mCRL2
                     toolset, and integrated into the Pleak toolset supporting privacy analysis of business
                     processes. The proposal has been evaluated using real scenarios.
