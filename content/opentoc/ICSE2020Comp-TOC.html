                  <p>This demo presents usage and implementation details of SLEMI. SLEMI is the first tool
                     to automatically find compiler bugs in the widely used cyber-physical system development
                     tool Simulink via Equivalence Modulo Input (EMI). EMI is a recent twist on differential
                     testing that promises more efficiency. SLEMI implements several novel mutation techniques
                     that deal with CPS language features that are not found in procedural languages. This
                     demo also introduces a new EMI-based mutation strategy that has already found a new
                     confirmed bug in Simulink version R2018a. To increase SLEMI's efficiency further,
                     this paper presents parallel generation of random, valid Simulink models. A video
                     demo of SLEMI is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oliPgOLT6eY.

                  <p>Service robots, a type of robots that perform useful tasks for humans, are foreseen
                     to be broadly used in the near future in both social and industrial scenarios. Those
                     robots will be required to operate in dynamic environments, collaborating among them
                     or with users. Specifying the list of requested tasks to be achieved by a robotic
                     team is far from being trivial. Therefore, mission specification languages and tools
                     need to be expressive enough to allow the specification of complex missions (e.g.,
                     detailing recovery actions), while being reachable by domain experts who might not
                     be knowledgeable of programming languages. To support domain experts, we developed
                     PROMISE, a Domain-Specific Language that allows mission specification for multiple
                     robots in a user-friendly, yet rigorous manner. PROMISE is built as an Eclipse plugin
                     that provides a textual and a graphical interface for mission specification. Our tool
                     is in turn integrated into a software framework, which provides functionalities as:
                     (1) automatic generation from specification, (2) sending of missions to the robotic
                     team; and (3) interpretation and management of missions during execution time. PROMISE
                     and its framework implementation have been validated through simulation and real-world
                     experiments with four different robotic models.

                  <p>WebAssembly is the newest language to arrive on the web. It features a binary code
                     format to serve as a compilation target for native languages such as C, C++, and Rust
                     and allows native applications to be ported for web usage. In the current implementation,
                     WebAssembly requires interaction with JavaScript at a minimum to initialize and additionally
                     to interact with Web APIs. As a result, understanding the function calls between WebAssembly
                     and JavaScript is crucial for testing, debugging, and maintaining applications utilizing
                     this new language. To this end, we develop a tool, WasmView, to visualize function
                     calls made between WebAssembly and JavaScript in a web application. WasmView also
                     records the stack traces and Screenshots of applications. This tool can help in supporting
                     visual testing for interactive applications and assisting refactoring for code updates.

                  <p>The use of mobile apps is increasingly widespread, and much effort is put into testing
                     these apps to make sure they behave as intended. In this demo, we present AppTestMigrator,
                     a technique and tool for migrating test cases between apps with similar functionality.
                     The intuition behind AppTestMigrator is that many apps share similarities in their
                     functionality, and these similarities often result in conceptually similar user interfaces
                     (through which that functionality is accessed). AppTestMigrator attempts to automatically
                     transform the sequence of events and oracles in a test case for an app (source app)
                     to events and oracles for another app (target app). The results of our preliminary
                     evaluation show the effectiveness of AppTestMigrator in migrating test cases between
                     mobile apps with similar functionality.

                  <p>As blockchain becomes increasingly popular across various industries in recent years,
                     many companies started designing and developing their own smart contract platforms
                     to enable better services on blockchain. While smart contracts are notoriously known
                     to be vulnerable to external attacks, such platform diversity further amplified the
                     security challenge. To mitigate this problem, we designed the very first cross-platform
                     security analyzer called Seraph for smart contracts. Specifically, Seraph enables
                     automated security analysis for different platforms built on two mainstream virtual
                     machine architectures, <em>i.e.</em>, EVM and WASM. To this end, Seraph introduces a set of general <em>connector API</em> to abstract interactions between the virtual machine and blockchain, <em>e.g.</em>, load and update storage data on blockchain. Moreover, we proposed the <em>symbolic semantic graph</em> to model critical dependencies and decoupled security analysis from contract code
                     as well. Our preliminary evaluation on four existing smart contract platforms demonstrated
                     the potential of Seraph in finding security threats both flexibly and accurately.

                  <p>Mutation testing can be used to assess the fault-detection capabilities of a given
                     test suite. To this aim, two characteristics of mutation testing frameworks are of
                     paramount importance: (i) they should generate mutants that are representative of
                     real faults; and (ii) they should provide a complete tool chain able to automatically
                     generate, inject, and test the mutants. To address the first point, we recently proposed
                     an approach using a Recurrent Neural Network Encoder-Decoder architecture to learn
                     mutants from ~787k faults mined from real programs. The empirical evaluation of this
                     approach confirmed its ability to generate mutants representative of real faults.
                     In this paper, we address the second point, presenting DeepMutation, a tool wrapping
                     our deep learning model into a fully automated tool chain able to generate, inject,
                     and test mutants learned from real faults.

                  <p>Ensuring correct trace links between different types of artifacts (requirements, architecture,
                     or code) is crucial for compliance in safety-critical domains, for consistency checking,
                     or change impact assessment. The point in time when trace links are created, however,
                     (i.e., immediately during development or weeks/months later) has a significant impact
                     on its quality. Assessing quality thus relies on obtaining a historical view on artifacts
                     and their trace links at a certain point in the past which provides valuable insights
                     on when, how, and by whom, trace links were created. This work presents <em>TimeTracer</em>, a tool that allows engineers to go back in time - not just to view the history of
                     artifacts but also the history of trace links associated with these artifacts. <em>TimeTracer</em> allows easy integration with different development support tools such as Jira; and
                     it stores artifacts, traces, and changes thereof in a unified artifact model.

                  <p>Establishing API mappings between libraries is a prerequisite step for library migration
                     tasks. Manually establishing API mappings is tedious due to the large number of APIs

                     meta-model of deep neural networks, consisting of generic configurable entities. Then,
                     it uses tools developed in the context of software product lines to generate diverse

                     allows researchers to generate seamlessly a large variety of models. Thereby, it helps
                     choosing appropriate DL models and performing experiments with diverse models (mitigating

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that the performance of deep learning models should be evaluated
                     using various important metrics such as robustness and neuron coverage, besides the
                     widely-used prediction accuracy metric. However, major deep learning frameworks currently
                     only provide APIs to evaluate a model's accuracy. In order to comprehensively assess
                     a deep learning model, framework users and researchers often need to implement new
                     metrics by themselves, which is a tedious job. What is worse, due to the large number
                     of hyper-parameters and inadequate documentation, evaluation results of some deep
                     learning models are hard to reproduce, especially when the models and metrics are
                     both new.
                  </p> 
                  <p>To ease the model evaluation in deep learning systems, we have developed <em>EvalDNN</em>, a user-friendly and extensible toolbox supporting multiple frameworks and metrics
                     with a set of carefully designed APIs. Using <em>EvalDNN</em>, evaluation of a pre-trained model with respect to different metrics can be done
                     with a few lines of code. We have evaluated <em>EvalDNN</em> on 79 models from TensorFlow, Keras, GluonCV, and PyTorch. As a result of our effort
                     made to reproduce the evaluation results of existing work, we release a performance

                     However, incomprehensible testing results make it difficult for developers to understand

                     results on multi-devices. FuRong builds a bug model with complete context information,

                     pre-trained Decision Tree classifier (with 18 bug category labels) to classify bugs.

                  <p>One of the major drawbacks of traditional automatic program repair (APR) techniques
                     is their dependence on a test suite as a repair specification. In practice, it is
                     often hard to obtain specification-quality test suites. This limits the performance
                     and hence the viability of such test-suite-based approaches. On the other hand, static-analysis-based
                     bug finding tools are increasingly being adopted in industry but still facing challenges
                     since the reported violations are viewed as not easily actionable. In previous work,
                     we proposed a novel technique that solves both these challenges through a technique
                     for automatically generating high-quality patches for static analysis violations by
                     learning from previous repair examples. In this paper, we present a tool Phoenix,
                     implementing this technique. We describe the architecture, user interfaces, and salient
                     features of Phoenix, and specific practical use cases of its technology. A video demonstrating

                     science and breaking new grounds in the ways that researchers can model and analyze
                     the cognitive processes of developers as they interact with software artifacts. However,
                     given the novelty of this line of research, only one tool exists to help researchers
                     represent and analyze this kind of multi-modal biometric data. While this tool does
                     help with visualizing temporal eyetracking and physiological data, it does not allow
                     for the mapping of physiological data to source code elements, instead projecting
                     information over images of code. One drawback of this is that researchers are still
                     unable to meaningfully combine and map physiological and eye tracking data to source
                     code artifacts. The use of images also bars the support of long or multiple code files,
                     which prevents researchers from analyzing data from experiments conducted in realistic

                     Hadoop, and Apache Spark are prevalent in many production services. Despite their
                     popularity, the quality of DISC applications suffers due to a lack of exhaustive and
                     automated testing. Current practices of testing DISC applications are limited to using
                     a small random sample of the entire input dataset which merely exposes any program
                     faults. Unlike SQL queries, testing DISC applications has new challenges due to a
                     composition of both dataflow and relational operators, and user-defined functions
                     (UDF) that could be arbitrarily long and complex.
                  </p> 
                  <p>To address this problem, we demonstrate a new white-box testing framework called BigTest
                     that takes an Apache Spark program as input and automatically generates synthetic,
                     concrete data for effective and efficient testing. BigTest combines the symbolic execution
                     of UDFs with the logical specifications of dataflow and relational operators to explore
                     all paths in a DISC application. Our experiments show that BigTest is capable of generating
                     test data that can reveal up to 2X more faults than the entire data set with 194X
                     less testing time. We implement BigTest in a Java-based command line tool with a pre-compile
                     binary jar. It exposes a configuration file in which a user can edit preferences,
                     including the path of a target program, the upper bound of loop exploration, and a

                  <p>Comprehensive test inputs are an essential ingredient for dynamic software analysis
                     techniques, yet are typically impossible to obtain and maintain. Automated input generation
                     techniques can supplant manual effort in many contexts, but they also exhibit inherent
                     limitations in practical applications. Therefore, the best approach to input generation
                     for a given application task necessarily entails compromise. Most symbolic execution
                     approaches maintain soundness by sacrificing completeness. In this paper, we take
                     the opposite approach and demonstrate PG-KLEE, an input generation tool that over-approximates
                     program behavior to achieve complete coverage. We also summarize some empirical results
                     that validate our claims. Our technique is detailed in an earlier paper [16], and
                     the source code of PG-KLEE is available from [2].

                  <p>Understanding an unfamiliar program is always a daunting task for any programmer,
                     either experienced or inexperienced. Many studies have shown that even an experienced
                     programmer who is already familiar with the code may still need to rediscover the
                     code frequently during software maintenance. The difficulties of program comprehension
                     is much more intense when a system is completely new. One well-known solution to this
                     notorious problem is to create effective technical documentation to make up for the
                     lack of knowledge.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The purpose of technical documentation is to achieve the transfer of knowledge. However,
                     creating effective technical documentation has been impeded by many problems in practice
                     [1]. In this paper, we propose a novel tool called GeekyNote to address the major
                     challenges in technical documentation. The key ideas GeekyNote proposes are: (1) documents
                     are annotated to versioned source code transparently; (2) formal textual writings
                     are discouraged and screencasts (or other forms of documents) are encouraged; (3)
                     the up-to-dateness between documents and code can be detected, measured, and managed;
                     (4) the documentation that works like a debugging-trace is supported; (5) couplings
                     can be easily created and managed for future maintenance needs; (6) how good a system
                     is documented can be measured. A demo video can be accessed at https://youtu.be/cBueuPVDgWM.

                  <p>With the rapid growth of Android devices, techniques that ensure high quality of mobile
                     applications (i.e., apps) are receiving more and more attention. It is well-accepted
                     that mutation analysis is an effective approach to simulate and locate realistic faults
                     in the program. However, there exist few practical mutation analysis tools for Android
                     apps. Even worse, existing mutation analysis tools tend to generate a large number
                     of mutants, hindering broader adoption of mutation analysis, let alone the remaining
                     high number of stillborn mutants. Additionally, mutation operators are usually pre-defined
                     by such tools, leaving users less ability to define specific operators to meet their
                     own needs. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose DroidMutator, a mutation
                     analysis tool specifically for Android apps with configurability and extensibility.
                     DroidMutator reduces the number of generated stillborn mutants through type checking,
                     and the scope of mutation operators can be customized so that it only generates mutants
                     in specific code blocks, thus generating fewer mutants with more concentrated purposes.
                     Furthermore, it allows users to easily extend their mutation operators. We have applied
                     DroidMutator on 50 open source Android apps and our experimental results show that
                     DroidMutator effectively reduces the number of stillborn mutants and improves the
                     efficiency of mutation analysis.

                     ("serverless") platform. Nimbus aims to soothe four main pain points experienced by
                     developers working on serverless applications: that testing can be difficult, that
                     deployment can be a slow and painful process, that it is challenging to avoid vendor

                     invocations.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Nimbus provides a number of features that aim to overcome these challenges when working
                     with serverless applications. It uses an annotation-based configuration to avoid having
                     to work with large configuration files. It aims to allow the code written to be cloud-agnostic.
                     It provides an environment for local testing where the complete application can be
                     run locally before deployment. Lastly, Nimbus provides mechanisms for optimising the
                     contents and size of the artifacts that are deployed to the cloud, which helps to
                     reduce both deployment times and cold start times.

                  <p>Software developed and verified using proof assistants, such as Coq, can provide trustworthiness
                     beyond that of software developed using traditional programming languages and testing
                     practices. However, guarantees from formal verification are only as good as the underlying
                     definitions and specification properties. If properties are incomplete, flaws in definitions
                     may not be captured during verification, which can lead to unexpected system behavior
                     and failures. Mutation analysis is a general technique for evaluating specifications
                     for adequacy and completeness, based on making small-scale changes to systems and
                     observing the results. We demonstrate mCoq, the first mutation analysis tool for Coq
                     projects. mCoq changes Coq definitions, with each change producing a modified project
                     version, called a mutant, whose proofs are exhaustively checked. If checking succeeds,
                     i.e., the mutant is live, this may indicate specification incompleteness. Since proof
                     checking can take a long time, we optimized mCoq to perform incremental and parallel
                     processing of mutants. By applying mCoq to popular Coq libraries, we found several
                     instances of incomplete and missing specifications manifested as live mutants. We
                     believe mCoq can be useful to proof engineers and researchers for analyzing software
                     verification projects. The demo video for mCoq can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/QhigpfQ7dNo.

                  <p>Message passing is the primary programming paradigm in high-performance computing.
                     However, developing message passing programs is challenging due to the non-determinism
                     caused by parallel execution and complex programming features such as non-deterministic
                     communications and asynchrony. We present MPI-SV, a symbolic verifier for verifying
                     the parallel C programs using message passing interface (MPI). MPI-SV combines symbolic

                     enlarge the scope of verifiable properties. We have applied MPI-SV to real-world MPI

                     in key scenarios, it is important to conduct automated integration tests, based on
                     distributed test components (called local testers) that are deployed close to the
                     system components to simulate inputs from the environment and monitor the interactions
                     with the environment and other system components. We say that a distributed test scenario
                     is locally controllable and locally observable if test inputs can be decided locally
                     and conformance errors can be detected locally by the local testers, without the need
                     for exchanging coordination messages between the test components during test execution

                  <p>Deep learning (DL) systems, though being widely used, still suffer from quality and
                     reliability issues. Researchers have put many efforts to investigate these issues.
                     One promising direction is to leverage uncertainty, an intrinsic characteristic of
                     DL systems when making decisions, to better understand their erroneous behavior. DL
                     system testing is an effective method to reveal potential defects before the deployment
                     into safety- and security-critical applications. Various techniques and criteria have
                     been designed to generate defect-triggers, i.e. adversarial examples (AEs). However,
                     whether these test inputs could achieve a full spectrum examination of DL systems
                     remains unknown and there still lacks understanding of the relation between AEs and
                     DL uncertainty. In this work, we first conduct an empirical study to uncover the characteristics
                     of AEs from the perspective of uncertainty. Then, we propose a novel approach to generate
                     inputs that are missed by existing techniques. Further, we investigate the usefulness
                     and effectiveness of the data for DL robustness enhancement.

                  <p>Due to the rapid development of deep neural networks, in recent years, machine translation
                     software has been widely adopted in people's daily lives, such as communicating with
                     foreigners or understanding political news from the neighbouring countries. However,
                     machine translation software could return incorrect translations because of the complexity
                     of the underlying network. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology
                     called <em>PaInv</em> for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that sentences of
                     different meanings should not have the same translation (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>pa</em>thological <em>in</em>variance). Specifically, PaInv generates syntactically similar but semantically different
                     sentences by replacing one word in the sentence and filter out unsuitable sentences
                     based on both syntactic and semantic information. We have applied PaInv to Google
                     Translate using 200 English sentences as input with three language settings: English‚ÜíHindi,
                     English‚ÜíChinese, and English‚ÜíGerman. PaInv can accurately find 331 pathological invariants
                     in total, revealing more than 100 translation errors.

                  <p>Testing cyber-physical system (CPS) development tools such as MathWorks' Simulink
                     is very important as they are widely used in design, simulation, and verification
                     of CPS data-flow models. Existing randomized differential testing frameworks such

                     to manually update the tool, whenever MathWorks updates model validity rules. To address
                     the limitations, we propose to learn validity rules automatically by learning a language
                     model using our framework DeepFuzzSL from existing corpus of Simulink models. In our

                  <p>Modern, agile software development methods rely on iterative work and improvement
                     cycles to deliver their claimed benefits. In Scrum, the most popular agile method,
                     process improvement is implemented through regular Retrospective meetings. In these
                     meetings, team members reflect on the latest development iteration and decide on improvement
                     actions. To identify potential issues, data on the completed iteration needs to be
                     gathered. The Scrum method itself does not prescribe these steps in detail. However,
                     Retrospective games, i.e. interactive group activities, have been proposed to encourage
                     the sharing of experiences and problems. These activities mostly rely on the collected

                     to assist in debugging and software maintenance. However, there exists no practical
                     guidelines on where to write logging statements. On one hand, adding too many logging
                     statements may introduce superfluously trivial logs and performance overheads. On
                     the other hand, logging too little may miss necessary runtime information. Thus, properly
                     deciding the logging location is a challenging task and a finer-grained understanding
                     of where to write logging statements is needed to assist developers in making logging
                     decisions. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to uncover guidelines on

                     surrounding code by combining both deep learning techniques and manual investigations.
                     From our preliminary results, we find that our deep learning models achieve over 90%
                     in precision and recall when trained using the syntactic (e.g., nodes in abstract
                     syntax tree) and semantic (e.g., variable names) features. However, cross-system models
                     trained using semantic features only have 45.6% in precision and 73.2% in recall,
                     while models trained using syntactic features still have over 90% precision and recall.
                     Our current progress highlights that there is an implicit syntactic logging guideline
                     across systems, and such information may be leveraged to uncover general logging guidelines.

                     resulting in many requests and reported issues. How to supply all of the needed maintenance
                     and development work is an open and sometimes controversial question.

                  <p>The software quality and reliability have been proved to be important during the program
                     development. There are many existing studies trying to help improve it on bug detection
                     and automated program repair processes. However, each of them has its own limitation
                     and the overall performance still have some improvement space. In this paper, we proposed
                     a deep learning framework to improve the software quality and reliability on these
                     two detect-fix processes. We used advanced code modeling and AI models to have some
                     improvements on the state-of-the-art approaches. The evaluation results show that
                     our approach can have a relative improvement up to 206% in terms of F-1 score when
                     comparing with baselines on bug detection and can have a relative improvement up to
                     19.8 times on the correct bug-fixing amount when comparing with baselines on automated
                     program repair. These results can prove that our framework can have an outstanding

                  <p>Web services often impose constraints that restrict the way in which two or more input
                     parameters can be combined to form valid calls to the service, i.e. <em>inter-parameter dependencies.</em> Current web API specification languages like the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) provide

                  <p>Cyber-attacks stealing confidential information are becoming increasingly frequent
                     and devastating as modern software systems store and manipulate greater amounts of
                     sensitive data. Leaking information about private user data, such as the financial
                     and medical records of individuals, trade secrets of companies and military secrets
                     of states can have drastic consequences. Confidentiality of such private data is critical
                     for users of these systems. Many software development practices, such as the encryption
                     of packages sent over a network, aim to protect the confidentiality of private data
                     by ensuring that an observer is unable to learn anything meaningful about a program's
                     secret input from its public output. Under these protections, the software system's
                     main communication channels, such as the content of the network packets it sends,
                     or the output it writes to a public file, should not leak information about the private
                     data. However, many software systems still contain serious security vulnerabilities.
                     Side channels are an important class of information leaks where secret information
                     can be captured through the observation of non-functional side effects of software
                     systems. Potential side channels include those in execution time, memory usage, size
                     and timings of network packets, and power consumption. Although side-channel vulnerabilities
                     due to hardware (such as vulnerabilities that exploit the cache behavior) have been
                     extensively studied [1, 2, 10, 13, 15-17, 19, 23], software side channels have only
                     recently become an active area of research, including recent results on software side-channel

                  <p>Test smell as analogous to code smell is a poor design choice in the implementation
                     of test code. Recently, the concept of test smell has become the utmost interest of
                     researchers and practitioners. Surveys show that developers' are aware of test smells
                     and their potential consequences in the software system. However, there is limited
                     empirical evidence for how developers address test smells during software evolution.
                     Thus, in this paper, we study 2 research questions: (RQ1) How do test smells evolve?

                     sub-optimal practice. In our study, we hope to fill the gap between academia and industry
                     by providing evidence of sub-optimal practice in the way developers address test smells,
                     and how it may be detrimental to the software.

                  <p>Virtualization and containerization have been two disruptive technologies in the past
                     few years. Both technologies have allowed isolating the applications with fewer resources
                     and have impacted fields such as Software Testing. In the field of testing, the execution
                     of the containerized/virtualized test suite has achieved great savings, but when the
                     complexity increases or the cost of deployment rises, there are open challenges like

                     towards smart resource identification and a proper organization of its execution in

                  <p>Software engineering in the industrial automation domain requires generic methods
                     to keep the development complexity at an acceptable level. However, nowadays various
                     PLC vendors use different dialects of the standardized programming languages in their
                     tools, which hinders the re-usability and interoperability across the platforms. The
                     service-oriented approaches can serve to overcome interoperability issues. In distributed
                     control systems, the functionality of an automation component can be offered to the
                     other parties that constitute a production system via a standardized interface, easing
                     the orchestration of the whole system. This paper proposes such a generic interface
                     that hides away the low-level implementation details of a particular functionality
                     and provides a common semantic model for the execution. Further, we show how using
                     such an interface can help to support and automate the overall engineering process,
                     combining the functionality of different components to fulfill a production task.
                     The reference implementation of the proposed concept was used in an industrial demonstrator,
                     which shows the benefits in the system flexibility due to components interoperability
                     and re-usability compared to the traditional control approaches.

                  <p>Program dependence is a fundamental concept to many software engineering tasks, yet
                     the traditional dependence analysis struggles to cope with common modern development
                     practices such as multi-lingual implementations and use of third-party libraries.
                     While Observation-based Slicing (ORBS) solves these issues and produces an accurate
                     slice, it has a scalability problem due to the need to build and execute the target
                     program multiple times. We would like to propose a radical change of perspective:
                     a useful dependence analysis needs to be scalable even if it approximates the dependency.
                     Our goal is a scalable approximate program dependence analysis via estimating the
                     likelihood of dependence. We claim that 1) using external information such as lexical
                     analysis or a development history, 2) learning dependence model from partial observations,
                     and 3) merging static, and observation-based approach would assist the proposition.
                     We expect that our technique would introduce a new perspective of program dependence
                     analysis into the likelihood of dependence. It would also broaden the capability of
                     the dependence analysis towards large and complex software.

                  <p>Problem: developers are increasingly adopting security practices in software projects
                     in response to cyber threats. Despite the additional effort required to perform those
                     practices, current cost models either do not consider security as an input or were
                     not properly validated with empirical data. Hypothesis: increasing degrees of application
                     of security practices and security features, motivated by security risks, lead to
                     growing levels of added software development effort. Such an effort increase can be
                     quantified through a parametric model that takes as input the usage degrees of security
                     practices and requirements and outputs the additional software development effort.
                     Contributions: the accurate prediction of secure software development effort will
                     support the provision of a proper amount of resources to projects. We also expect
                     that the quantification of the security effort will contribute to advance research
                     on the cost-effectiveness of software security.

                  <p>Empirical studies have shown that mobile applications that do not drain battery usually
                     get good ratings from users. To make mobile application energy efficient many studies
                     have been published that present refactoring guidelines and tools to optimize the
                     code. However, these guidelines cannot be generalized w.r.t energy efficiency, as
                     there is not enough energy related data for every context. Existing energy enhancement
                     tools/profilers are mostly prototypes applicable to only a small subset of energy
                     related problems. In addition, the existing guidelines and tools mostly address the
                     energy issues once they have already been introduced. My goal is to add to the existing
                     energy related data by evaluating the energy consumption of various code smell refactorings
                     and third-party libraries used in Android development. Data from such evaluations
                     could provide generalized contextual guidelines that could be used during application

                  <p>Software application programming interfaces (APIs) are a ubiquitous part of Software
                     Engineering. The evolution of these APIs requires constant effort from their developers
                     and users alike. API developers must constantly balance keeping their products modern
                     whilst keeping them as stable as possible. Meanwhile, API users must continually be
                     on the lookout to adapt to changes that could break their applications. As APIs become

                     of them focuses on identifying and detecting TD from a single stage of development.
                     There are also studies that analyze vulnerabilities focusing on some phases of the

                     of software products, sharing common features. Effectively achieving the above-mentioned
                     goals requires reuse analysis of the product line features. Existing requirements
                     reuse analysis approaches are not focused on recommending product line features, that
                     can be reused to realize new customer requirements. Hypothesis: Given that the customer
                     requirements are linked to product line features' description satisfying them: then
                     the customer requirements can be clustered based on patterns and similarities, preserving
                     the historic reuse information. New customer requirements can be evaluated against

                  <p>Developers write logging statements to generate logs and record system execution behaviors.
                     Such logs are widely used for a variety of tasks, such as debugging, testing, program
                     comprehension, and performance analysis. However, there exists no practical guidelines
                     on how to write logging statements; hence, making the logging decision a very challenging
                     task. There are two main challenges that developers are facing while making logging
                     decisions: 1) Difficult to accurately and succinctly record execution behaviors; and
                     2) Hard to decide where to write logging statements. This thesis proposes a series

                  <p>Testing of web APIs is nowadays more critical than ever before, as they are the current
                     standard for software integration. A bug in an organization's web API could have a
                     huge impact both internally (services relying on that API) and externally (third-party
                     applications and end users). Most existing tools and testing approaches require writing
                     tests or instrumenting the system under test (SUT). The main aim of this dissertation
                     is to take web API testing to an unprecedented level of automation and thoroughness.
                     To this end, we plan to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the autonomous
                     detection of software failures. Specifically, the idea is to develop intelligent programs
                     (we call them "bots") capable of generating hundreds, thousands or even millions of
                     test inputs and to evaluate whether the test outputs are correct based on: 1) patterns
                     learned from previous executions of the SUT; and 2) knowledge gained from analyzing
                     thousands of similar programs. Evaluation results of our initial prototype are promising,
                     with bugs being automatically detected in some real-world APIs.

                  <p>Performance is an important aspect of software quality. The goals of performance are
                     typically defined by setting upper and lower bounds for response time and throughput
                     of a system and physical level measurements such as CPU, memory and I/O. To meet such
                     performance goals, several performance-related activities are needed in development
                     (Dev) and operations (Ops). In fact, large software system failures are often due
                     to performance issues rather than functional bugs. One of the most important performance
                     issues is performance regression. Although performance regressions are not all bugs,
                     they often have a direct impact on users' experience of the system. The process of
                     detection of performance regressions in development and operations is faced with challenges.
                     First, the detection of performance regression is conducted after the fact, i.e.,
                     after the system is built and deployed in the field or dedicated performance testing
                     environments. Large amounts of resources are required to detect, locate, understand
                     and fix performance regressions at such a late stage in the development cycle. Second,
                     even we can detect a performance regression, it is extremely hard to fix it because
                     other changes are applied to the system after the introduction of the regression.
                     These challenges call for further in-depth analyses of the performance regression.
                     In this dissertation, to avoid performance regression slipping into operation, we
                     first perform an exploratory study on the source code changes that introduce performance
                     regressions in order to understand root-causes of performance regression in the source
                     code level. Second, we propose an approach that automatically predicts whether a test
                     would manifest performance regressions in a code commit. To assist practitioners to
                     analyze system performance with operational data, we propose an approach to recovering
                     field-representative workload that can be used to detect performance regression. We
                     also propose that using execution logs generated by unit tests to predict performance
                     regression in load tests.

                     of API-based software systems, it could be vital. Quantitative attributes can be thought
                     of as attributes determining the <em>Quality of Service</em> - QoS provided by a software component published as a service. In this sense, they
                     play a determinant role in classifying software artifacts according to specific needs

                  <p>Identifying the source of a program failure plays an integral role in maintaining
                     software quality. Both fault localisation and defect prediction aim to locate faults:
                     fault localisation aims to locate faults after they are revealed while defect prediction
                     aims to locate yet-to-happen faults. Despite sharing a similar goal, fault localisation
                     and defect prediction have been studied as separate topics, mainly due to the difference
                     in available data to exploit. In our doctoral research, we aim to bridge fault localisation
                     and defect prediction. Our work is divided into three parts: 1) applying defect prediction
                     to fault localisation, i.e., DP2FL, 2) applying fault localisation to defect prediction,
                     i.e., FL2DP, 3) consecutive application of DP2FL and FL2DP in a single framework.
                     We expect the synergy between fault localisation and defect prediction not only to
                     improve the accuracy of each process but to allow us to build a single model that
                     gradually improve the overall software quality throughout the entire software development

                  <p>Software testing prevents and detects the introduction of faults and bugs during the
                     process of evolving and delivering reliable software. As an important software development
                     activity, testing has been intensively studied to measure test code quality and effectiveness,
                     and assist professional developers and testers with automated test generation tools.
                     In recent years, testing has been attracting educators' attention and has been integrated
                     into some Computer Science education programs. Understanding challenges and problems
                     faced by students can help inform educators the topics that require extra attention
                     and practice when presenting testing concepts and techniques.

                  <p>In my research, I study how students implement and modify source code given unit tests,
                     and how they perceive and perform unit testing. I propose to quantitatively measure
                     the quality of student-written test code, and qualitatively identify the common mistakes
                     and bad smells observed in student-written test code. We compare the performance of
                     students and professionals, who vary in prior testing experience, to investigate the
                     factors that lead to high-quality test code. The ultimate goal of my research is to
                     address the challenges students encountered during test code composition and improve
                     their testing skills with supportive tools or guidance.

                     software supply channel. However, trust on FOSS products is still an issue. Quality

                  <p>In modern software engineering, developers have to work with constantly evolving,
                     interconnected software systems. Understanding how and why these systems and their
                     dependencies between each other change is therefore an essential step in improving
                     or maintaining them. For this, it is important to know what changed and how these
                     changes influence the system. Most currently used tools that help developers to understand
                     source code changes either use the textual representation of source code, allowing
                     for a coarse-grained overview, or use the AST (abstract syntax tree) representation
                     of source code to extract more fine-grained changes. We plan to improve the accuracy
                     and classification of the extracted source code changes and to extend them by analysing
                     the fine-grained changes of source code dependencies. We also propose a dynamical
                     analysis of the impact of the previously extracted changes on performance metrics.
                     This helps to understand what changes caused a certain change in program behaviour.
                     We plan to use and combine this information to generate accurate and detailed change
                     overviews that bridge the gap between existing coarse-grained solutions and the raw
                     changes contained in the code, aiming to reduce the developers' time spent reading
                     changed code and help them to quickly understand the changes between two versions

                  <p>Context: Software has become ubiquitous in every corner of modern societies. During the last
                     five decades, software engineering has also changed significantly to advance the development
                     of various types and scales of software products. In this context, Software Engineering
                     Education plays an essential role in keeping students updated with software technologies,
                     processes, and practices that are popular in industries. Aim: In this PhD work, I want to answer the following research questions: To what extent
                     software engineering trends are present in software engineering education? In which
                     way software startup in growth phase characteristics can be transferred into software
                     engineering education context? What is the impact of software startup engineering
                     in the curriculum and to software engineering students? Method: I utilize literature review and mix-methods approaches (quantitative and qualitative
                     data and methods triangulation) in gathering empirical evidence. More precisely, I
                     split my research method into two phases. The first phase of the research will acquire
                     knowledge and insight based on the existing literature review. The second research
                     phase will split the focus in two directions. Firstly, I shall gather empirical evidence
                     on how software startup practices are present in software engineering education. Secondly,
                     I will conduct parallel investigations into SE practices in growth phase software
                     startups. Expected Results: I argue that software startup engineering practices are an ultimate tool for software
                     engineering education approaches. I expect students to acquire software engineering
                     skills in a more realistic context while using software startup in growth phase practices.

                  <p>Technical debt (TD) is an economical term used to depict non-optimal choices made
                     in the software development process. It occurs usually when developers take shortcuts
                     instead of following agreed upon development practices, and unchecked growth of technical
                     debt can start to incur negative effects for software development processes.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Technical debt detection and management is mainly done manually, and this is both
                     slow and costly way of detecting technical debt. Automatic detection would solve this
                     issue, but even state-of-the-art tools of today do not accurately detect the appearance
                     of technical debt. Therefore, increasing the accuracy of automatic classification
                     is of high importance, so that we could eliminate significant portion from the costs
                     relating to technical debt detection.
                  </p> 
                  <p>This research aims to solve the problem in detection accuracy by bringing in together
                     static code analysis and natural language processing. This combination of techniques
                     will allow more accurate detection of technical debt, when compared to them being
                     used separately from each other. Research also aims to discover themes and topics
                     from written developer messages that can be linked to technical debt. These can help
                     us to understand technical debt from developers' viewpoint. Finally, we will build
                     an open-source tool/plugin that can be used to accurately detect technical debt using
                     both static analysis and natural language processing methods.

                  <p>Data modeling in Cassandra databases follows a query-driven approach where each table
                     is created to satisfy a query, leading to repeated data as the Cassandra model is
                     not normalized by design. Consequently, developers bear the responsibility to maintain
                     the data integrity at the application level, as opposed to when the model is normalized.
                     This is done by embedding in the client application the appropriate statements to
                     perform data changes, which is error prone. Cassandra data modeling methodologies
                     have emerged to cope with this problem by proposing the use of a conceptual model
                     to generate the logical model, solving the data modeling problem but not the data
                     integrity one. In this thesis we address the problem of the integrity of these data
                     by proposing a method that, given a data change at either the conceptual or the logical
                     level, determines the executable statements that should be issued to preserve the
                     data integrity. Additionally, as this integrity may also be lost as a consequence
                     of creating new data structures in the logical model, we complement our method to
                     preserve data integrity in these scenarios. Furthermore, we address the creation of
                     data structures at the conceptual level to represent a normalized version of newly
                     created data structures in the logical model.

                  <p>Many developers don't understand how to, or recognize the need to develop accessible
                     software. To address this, we have created five educational <em>Accessibility Learning Labs</em> (ALL) using an experiential learning structure. Each of these labs addresses a foundational
                     concept in computing accessibility and both inform participants about foundational
                     concepts in creating accessible software while also demonstrating the necessity of
                     creating accessible software. The hosted labs provide a complete educational experience,
                     containing materials such as lecture slides, activities, and quizzes.
                  </p> 
                  <p>We evaluated the labs in ten sections of a CS2 course at our university, with 276
                     students participating. Our primary findings include: I) The labs are an effective
                     way to inform participants about foundational topics in creating accessible software
                     II) The labs demonstrate the potential benefits of our proposed experiential learning
                     format in motivating participants about the importance of creating accessible software
                     III) The labs demonstrate that empathy material increases learning retention. Created

                     and there is high demand for DevOps practitioners in industry. Therefore, we studied
                     whether undergraduates acquired adequate DevOps skills to fulfill the demand for DevOps
                     practitioners in industry. We employed Grounded Theory (GT), a social science qualitative
                     research methodology, to study DevOps education from academic and industrial perspectives.
                     In academia, academics were not motivated to learn or adopt DevOps, and we did not
                     find strong evidence of academics teaching DevOps. Academics need incentives to adopt
                     DevOps, in order to stimulate interest in teaching DevOps. In industry, DevOps practitioners
                     lack clearly defined roles and responsibilities, for the DevOps topic is diverse and
                     growing too fast. Therefore, practitioners can only learn DevOps through hands-on
                     working experience. As a result, academic institutions should provide fundamental
                     DevOps education (in culture, procedure, and technology) to prepare students for their
                     future DevOps advancement in industry. Based on our findings, we proposed five groups

                  <p>Alert is a kind of key data source in monitoring system for online service systems,
                     which is used to record the anomalies in service components and report to engineers.
                     In general, the occurrence of a service failure tends to be along with a large number
                     of alerts, which is called alert storm. However, alert storm brings great challenges to diagnose the failure, since it is
                     time-consuming and tedious for engineers to investigate such an overwhelming number
                     of alerts manually. To help understand alert storm, we conduct the first empirical
                     study of alert storm based on large-scale real-world alert data and gain some valuable
                     insights. Based on the findings, we propose a novel approach to handling alert storm.
                     Specifically, this approach includes alert storm detection which aims to identify
                     alert storm accurately, and alert storm summary which aims to recommend a small set
                     of representative alerts to engineers for failure diagnosis. Our experimental study
                     on real-world dataset demonstrates that our alert storm detection can achieve high
                     F1-score (larger than 0.9). Besides, our alert storm summary can reduce the number
                     of alerts that need to be examined by more than 98% and discover useful alerts accurately.

                     Despite the importance of diversity in the broad field of computing, there is not
                     only a comparatively low representation of women but also other underrepresented minorities,
                     such as indigenous people. To gain insights about their career choice, we conducted
                     10 interviews with Andean indigenous. The findings reveal that seven factors (social
                     support, exposure to digital technology, autonomy of use, purpose of use, digital
                     skill, identity, and work ethic) help to understand how and why indigenous people
                     choose a career related to Software Engineering. This exploratory study also contributes
                     to challenge common stereotypes and perceptions about indigenous people as low-qualified
                     workers, academically untalented, and unmotivated.

                  <p>Data scientists frequently analyze data by writing scripts. We conducted a contextual
                     inquiry with interdisciplinary researchers, which revealed that parameter tuning is
                     a highly iterative process and that debugging is time-consuming. As analysis scripts
                     evolve and become more complex, analysts have difficulty conceptualizing their workflow.
                     In particular, after editing a script, it becomes difficult to determine precisely
                     which code blocks depend on the edit. Consequently, scientists frequently re-run entire
                     scripts instead of re-running only the necessary parts. We present ProvBuild, a data
                     analysis environment that uses change impact analysis [1] to improve the iterative
                     debugging process in script-based workflow pipelines. ProvBuild is a tool that leverages
                     language-level provenance [2] to streamline the debugging process by reducing programmer
                     cognitive load and decreasing subsequent runtimes, leading to an overall reduction
                     in elapsed debugging time. ProvBuild uses provenance to track dependencies in a script.
                     When an analyst debugs a script, ProvBuild generates a simplified script that contains
                     only the information necessary to debug a particular problem. We demonstrate that
                     debugging the simplified script lowers a programmer's cognitive load and permits faster
                     re-execution when testing changes. The combination of reduced cognitive load and shorter
                     runtime reduces the time necessary to debug a script. We quantitatively and qualitatively
                     show that even though ProvBuild introduces overhead during a script's first execution,
                     it is a more efficient way for users to debug and tune complex workflows. ProvBuild
                     demonstrates a novel use of language-level provenance, in which it is used to proactively
                     improve programmer productively rather than merely providing a way to retroactively
                     gain insight into a body of code. To the best of our knowledge, ProvBuild is a novel
                     application of change impact analysis and it is the first debugging tool to leverage
                     language-level provenance to reduce cognitive load and execution time.

                  <p>The notion of forking has changed with the rise of distributed version control systems
                     and social coding environments, like GitHub. Traditionally forking refers to splitting
                     off an independent development branch (which we call <em>hard forks</em>); research on hard forks, conducted mostly in pre-GitHub days showed that hard forks
                     were often seen critical as they may fragment a community. Today, in social coding
                     environments, open-source developers are encouraged to fork a project in order to
                     contribute to the community (which we call <em>social forks</em>), which may have also influenced perceptions and practices around hard forks. To
                     revisit hard forks, we identify, study, and classify 15,306 hard forks on GitHub and
                     interview 18 owners of hard forks or forked repositories. We find that, among others,
                     hard forks often evolve out of social forks rather than being planned deliberately
                     and that perception about hard forks have indeed changed dramatically, seeing them
                     often as a positive non-competitive alternative to the original project.

                     and practical defenses for such systems against various security vulnerabilities such
                     as sensitive data leaks are urgently needed. However, most existing solutions are
                     limited to centralized programs. For real-world distributed systems which are of large
                     scales, current solutions commonly face one or more of scalability, applicability,
                     and portability challenges. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel dynamic
                     taint analysis for enterprise-scale distributed systems. To achieve scalability, we
                     use a multi-phase analysis strategy to reduce the overall cost. We infer implicit
                     dependencies via partial-ordering method events in distributed programs to address
                     the applicability challenge. To achieve greater portability, the analysis is designed
                     to work at an application level without customizing platforms. Empirical results have
                     shown promising scalability and capabilities of our approach.

                  <p>Reentrancy bugs in smart contracts caused a devastating financial loss in 2016, considered
                     as one of the most severe vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Most of the existing
                     general-purpose security tools for smart contracts have claimed to be able to detect

                     (PPTs) to support fast yet precise path feasibility checking. We have implemented
                     our approach and compared Clairvoyance with three state-of-the-art tools on 17770

                  <p>The computing education community has shown a long-time interest in how to analyze
                     the Object-Oriented (OO) source code developed by students to provide them with useful
                     formative tips. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an approach to analyze how
                     students use Java and its language constructs. The approach is implemented through
                     a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) and it is based on the analysis
                     of the most common violations of the OO paradigm in the student source code. Moreover,
                     the IDE supports the automatic generation of reports about student's mistakes and
                     misconceptions that can be used by instructors to improve the course design. The paper

                     among code segments, which is similar to the distribution of keywords among documents.
                     It motivates us to leverage statistical features to discriminate compatibility-related

                  <p>Developers are known to keep third-party dependencies of their projects outdated even
                     if some of them are affected by known vulnerabilities. In this study we aim to understand
                     <em>why</em> they do so. For this, we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with developers
                     of both large and small-medium enterprises located in nine countries. All interviews
                     were transcribed, coded, and analyzed according to applied thematic analysis. The
                     results of the study reveal important aspects of developers' practices that should
                     be considered by security researchers and dependency tool developers to improve the
                     security of the dependency management process.

                  <p>Just because software developers say they believe in "X", that does not necessarily
                     mean that "X" is true. As shown here, there exist numerous beliefs listed in the recent
                     Software Engineering literature which are only supported by small portions of the
                     available data. Hence we ask what is the source of this disconnect between beliefs
                     and evidence?.
                  </p> 
                  <p>To answer this question we look for evidence for ten beliefs within 300,000+ changes
                     seen in dozens of open-source projects. Some of those beliefs had strong support across
                     all the projects; specifically, <em>"A commit that involves more added and removed lines is more bug-prone"</em> and <em>"Files with fewer lines contributed by their owners (who contribute most changes)
                        are bug-prone".</em></p> 
                  <p>Most of the widely-held beliefs studied are only sporadically supported in the data;
                     i.e. large effects can appear in project data and then disappear in subsequent releases.
                     Such sporadic support explains why developers believe things that were relevant to
                     their prior work, but not necessarily their current work.

                  <p>Jupyter notebooks---documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and
                     narrative text---now are among the most popular means to compute, present, discuss
                     and disseminate scientific findings. In principle, Jupyter notebooks should easily
                     allow to reproduce and extend scientific computations and their findings; but in practice,
                     this is not the case. The individual code cells in Jupyter notebooks can be executed
                     <em>in any order</em>, with identifier usages preceding their definitions and results preceding their computations.
                     In a sample of 936 published notebooks that would be executable in principle, we found
                     that 73% of them would not be reproducible with straightforward approaches, requiring
                     humans to infer (and often guess) the order in which the authors created the cells.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In this paper, we present an approach to (1) automatically satisfy dependencies between
                     code cells to reconstruct possible execution orders of the cells; and (2) instrument
                     code cells to mitigate the impact of non-reproducible statements (i.e., random functions)
                     in Jupyter notebooks. Our <em>Osiris</em> prototype takes a notebook as input and outputs the possible execution schemes that
                     reproduce the exact notebook results. In our sample, Osiris was able to reconstruct
                     such schemes for 82.23% of all executable notebooks, which has more than three times
                     better than the state-of-the-art; the resulting reordered code is valid program code
                     and thus available for further testing and analysis.

                  <p>Issue triage is a manual and time consuming process for both open and closed source
                     software projects. Triagers first validate the issue reports and then find the appropriate

                  <p>Statistical language modeling techniques have successfully been applied to large source
                     code corpora, yielding a variety of new software development tools, such as tools
                     for code suggestion, improving readability, and API migration. A major issue with
                     these techniques is that code introduces new vocabulary at a far higher rate than
                     natural language, as new identifier names proliferate. Both large vocabularies and
                     out-of-vocabulary issues severely affect Neural Language Models (NLMs) of source code,

                  <p>With the global increase in demand for online tertiary education, teachers are facing
                     unique challenges in scaling assessment activities and meaningful student engagement.
                     One such aspect is contract cheating behaviours exhibited in the modern online environment
                     --- posing a threat to the academic integrity of tertiary education. These obstacles
                     amplify when applied to traditionally difficult domains like introductory programming
                     education. Prior research on contract cheating identification proposes that while
                     challenging, techniques such as developing strong teacher-student relationships, and
                     real-time discussions may lead to instances of identifying contract cheating behaviours.
                     The proposition, then, is to scale real-time, student-teacher discussions with large,
                     online cohorts --- similar to those discussions which traditionally took place in
                     the classroom. This poster paper presents Intelligent Discussion Comments (IDCs):
                     A scalable, teacher-asynchronous system which engages students in real-time discussions
                     to extract authentic student understanding. Artificial intelligence services such
                     as voice identification and transcription enrich the discussion process, supporting
                     the teaching team in their decision-making process.

                     expected length, value, uniqueness, and other properties of the stored data. Correctly
                     specifying and checking such constraints are crucial for reliability, maintainability,

                     database and needs to continue serving users despite frequent software upgrades [2]
                     and data migration [1]. As a result, consistently and comprehensively specifying data

                  <p>We found that many of the reported erroneous cases in popular DNN image classifiers
                     occur because the trained models confuse one class with another or show biases towards
                     some classes over others. Most existing DNN testing techniques focus on per-image
                     violations, so fail to detect class-level confusions or biases. We developed a testing
                     technique to automatically detect class-based confusion and bias errors in DNN-driven
                     image classification software. We evaluated our implementation, DeepInspect, on several
                     popular image classifiers with precision up to 100% (avg. 72.6%) for confusion errors,
                     and up to 84.3% (avg. 66.8%) for bias errors.

                  <p><em>Context</em>: Programmers frequently look for the code of previously solved problems that they
                     can adapt for their own problem. Despite existing example code on the web, on sites
                     like Stack Overflow, cryptographic Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are commonly
                     misused. There is little known about what makes examples helpful for developers in
                     using crypto APIs. Analogical problem solving is a psychological theory that investigates
                     how people use known solutions to solve new problems. There is evidence that the capacity
                     to reason and solve novel problems a.k.a Fluid Intelligence (<em>Gf</em>) and structurally and procedurally similar solutions support problem solving. <em>Aim</em>: Our goal is to understand whether similarity and <em>Gf</em> also have an effect in the context of using cryptographic APIs with the help of code
                     examples. <em>Method</em>: We conducted a controlled experiment with 76 student participants developing with
                     or without procedurally similar examples, one of two Java crypto libraries and measured
                     the <em>Gf</em> of the participants as well as the effect on usability (effectiveness, efficiency,
                     satisfaction) and security bugs. <em>Results</em>: We observed a strong effect of code examples with a high procedural similarity on
                     all dependent variables. Fluid intelligence <em>Gf</em> had no effect. It also made no difference which library the participants used. <em>Conclusions</em>: Example code must be more highly similar to a concrete solution, not very abstract
                     and generic to have a positive effect in a development task.

                  <p>Mobile app users post their opinion about the apps, report bugs or request features
                     on various platforms, the main one being App Stores. Previous research suggests that
                     Twitter should be used as an additional resource to receive users' feedback, as app
                     users tweet different issues. Although the classification and review summarization
                     methods are developed previously for each platform separately, manual investigation

                     that are discussed on App Store or Twitter. In this paper, we propose a framework

                  <p>Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for systematically exploring program paths,
                     but scaling symbolic execution to practical programs remains challenging. State-of-the-art
                     techniques face the challenge to efficiently explore incremental behaviors, especially
                     for highly coupled programs with complex control and data dependency. In this paper,
                     we present a novel approach for incremental symbolic execution based on an iteration
                     loop between path exploration and path suffixes summarization. On one hand, the explored
                     paths are summarized to enable more precise identification of affected paths; on the
                     other hand, the summary guides path exploration to prune paths that have no incremental
                     behaviors. We implemented the prototype of our approach and conducted experiments
                     on a set of real-world applications. The results show that it is efficient and effective
                     in exploring incremental behaviors.

                  <p>OSS ecosystems promote code reuse, and knowledge sharing across projects within them.
                     An ecosystem's developers often develop similar activity patterns which might impact
                     project outcomes in an ecosystem-specific way. Since elite developers play critical
                     roles in most OSS projects, investigating their behaviors at the ecosystem level becomes
                     urgent. Thus, we aim to investigate elite developers' activities and their relationships
                     with project outcomes (productivity and quality). We design an large scale empirical
                     study which characterizes elite developers' activity profiles and identifies the relationships
                     between their effort allocations and project outcomes across five ecosystems. Our

                  <p>The need for mobile applications and mobile programming is increasing due to the continuous
                     rise in the pervasiveness of mobile devices. Developers often refer to video programming
                     tutorials to learn more about mobile programming topics. To find the right video to
                     watch, developers typically skim over several videos, looking at their title, description,
                     and video content in order to determine if they are relevant to their information
                     needs. Unfortunately, the title and description do not always provide an accurate
                     overview, and skimming over videos is time-consuming and can lead to missing important
                     information. We propose a novel approach that locates and extracts the GUI screens
                     showcased in a video tutorial, then selects and displays the most representative ones
                     to provide a GUI-focused overview of the video. We believe this overview can be used
                     by developers as an additional source of information for determining if a video contains
                     the information they need. To evaluate our approach, we performed an empirical study
                     on iOS and Android programming screencasts which investigates the accuracy of our
                     automated GUI extraction. The results reveal that our approach can detect and extract
                     GUI screens with an accuracy of 94%.

                     The analysis of API forums can be a critical step towards automated question and answer
                     approaches. In this poster, we empirically study three API forums: Twitter, eBay,

                  <p><em>Divergent forks</em> are a common practice in open-source software development to perform long-term, independent
                     and diverging development on top of a popular source repository. However, keeping
                     such divergent <em>downstream</em> forks in sync with the <em>upstream</em> source evolution poses engineering challenges in terms of frequent merge conflicts.
                     In this work, we conduct the first industrial case study of frequent merges from upstream
                     and the resulting merge conflicts, in the context of Microsoft Edge development. The
                     study consists of two parts. First, we describe the nature of merge conflicts that
                     arise due to merges from upstream. Second, we investigate the feasibility of automatically
                     fixing a class of merge conflicts related to <em>build breaks</em> that consume a significant amount of developer time to root-cause and fix. Towards
                     this end, we have implemented a tool MrgBldBrkFixer and evaluate it on three months

                     software engineering teachers to focus on topics such as code smells in their software
                     engineering courses to bring awareness among students on the impact of code smells
                     and bad design choices, not just for the software but also for the environment. Thus,
                     we propose a desktop game named <em>Refactor4Green</em> to teach code smells and refactoring to novice programmers. The core idea of the
                     game is to introduce code smells with refactoring choices through the theme of a green
                     environment. We conducted a preliminary study with university students and got positive
                     feedback from 83.06% of the participants.

                  <p>To give students as authentic learning experience as possible, many software-focused
                     degrees incorporate team-based capstone projects in the final year of study. Designing
                     capstone projects, however, is not a trivial undertaking, and a number of constraints
                     need to be considered, especially when it comes to defining learning outcomes, choosing
                     clients and projects, providing guidance to students, creating an effective project
                     "support infrastructure", and measuring student outcomes. To address these challenges,
                     we propose a novel, scalable model for managing capstone projects, called ACE, that
                     adapts Spotify's <em>Squads and Tribes</em> organization to an educational setting. We present our motivation, the key components
                     of the model, its adoption, and refer to preliminary observations.

                  <p>Ethical and social problems of the emerging technology of self-driving cars can best
                     be addressed through an applied engineering ethical approach. However, currently social
                     and ethical problems are typically being presented in terms of an idealized unsolvable
                     decision-making problem, the so-called Trolley Problem. Instead, we propose that ethical
                     analysis should focus on the study of ethics of complex real-world engineering problems.
                     As software plays a crucial role in the control of self-driving cars, software engineering
                     solutions should handle actual ethical and social considerations. We take a closer
                     look at the regulative instruments, standards, design, and implementations of components,
                     systems, and services and we present practical social and ethical challenges that
                     must be met in the ecology of the socio-technological system of self-driving cars
                     which implies novel expectations for software engineering in the automotive industry.
