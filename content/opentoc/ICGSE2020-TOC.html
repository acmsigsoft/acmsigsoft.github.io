                  <p>We report on a longitudinal case study conducted at the Italian site of a large software
                     company to further our understanding of how development and communication tools can
                     be improved to better support agile practices and collaboration. After observing inconsistencies
                     in the way communication tools (i.e., email, Skype, and Slack) were used, we first
                     reinforced the use of Slack as the central hub for internal communication, while setting
                     clear rules regarding tools usage. As a second main change, we refactored the Jira
                     Scrum board into two separate boards, a detailed one for developers and a high-level
                     one for managers, while also introducing automation rules and the integration with
                     Slack. The first change revealed that the teams of developers used and appreciated
                     Slack differently with the QA team being the most favorable and that the use of channels
                     is hindered by automatic notifications from development tools (e.g., Jenkins). The
                     findings from the second change show that 85% of the interviewees reported perceived
                     improvements in their workflow. Despite the limitations due to the single nature of
                     the reported case, we highlight the importance for companies to reflect on how to
                     properly set up their agile work environment to improve communication and facilitate
                     collaboration.

                     struggle to collaborate across geographical distance, nationalities, and languages.
                     Prior research documents how the use of national cultural differences as an argument
                     for failed collaboration is common amongst people working in GSE, which has made IT
                     companies blind to the fundamental challenges of GSE work emerging upon the conditions
                     for the actual conduct of work and practices undertaken by human actors. Based on
                     an interventionist ethnographic study conducted within a Danish IT company, we present
                     the results of attending to <em>implicit bias</em> as an approach to combat pervasive practices that deploy static cultural narratives
                     and negative stereotypes in GSE. We find that implicit bias is a useful grip for moving
                     discussions beyond negative cultural rhetoric and to reconsider the actual and locally
                     situated collaboration-related problems that exist within organizations involved in

                  <p>Software Ecosystem (SECO) comprises third-party developers cooperating and competing
                     when contributing to a platform provided by a central organization (keystone). A keystone
                     has invested in a Developer Relations (DevRel) internal team as a global business
                     strategy to attract and engage a critical mass of third-party developers in producing
                     and evolving contributions. For this reason, the DevRel team should promote social
                     relationships among SECO actors and synergy among keystone' goals and developers'
                     expectations. It can help to establish and sustain a competitive value creation network
                     (VCN) within a SECO that must survive to inherit changes. However, it is still a challenge
                     the way DevRel team can act on a SECO to better engage the developers' communities
                     aiming to establish a robust VCN. In this paper, we advance on investigating the perceptions
                     of 31 DevRel practitioners from large, medium and small-size companies based on seven
                     countries about value creation in DevRel. We found 55 elements of value creation distributed

                  <p>Community smells are symptoms of organizational and social issues within the software
                     development community that often increase the project costs and impact software quality.
                     Recent studies have identified a variety of community smells and defined them as suboptimal
                     patterns connected to organizational-social structures in the software development
                     community such as the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration. Recognizing
                     the advantages of the early detection of potential community smells in a software
                     project, we introduce a novel approach that learns from various community organizational
                     and social practices to provide an automated support for detecting community smells.
                     In particular, our approach learns from a set of interleaving organizational-social
                     symptoms that characterize the existence of community smell instances in a software
                     project. We build a multi-label learning model to detect 8 common types of community
                     smells. We use the ensemble classifier chain (ECC) model that transforms multi-label
                     problems into several single-label problems which are solved using genetic programming
                     (GP) to find the optimal detection rules for each smell type. To evaluate the performance
                     of our approach, we conducted an empirical study on a benchmark of 103 open source
                     projects and 407 community smell instances. The statistical tests of our results show
                     that our approach can detect the eight considered smell types with an average F-measure
                     of 89% achieving a better performance compared to different state-of-the-art techniques.
                     Furthermore, we found that the most influential factors that best characterize community
                     smells include the social network density and closeness centrality as well as the
                     standard deviation of the number of developers per time zone and per community.

                  <p>In globally distributed software development, many software developers have to collaborate
                     and deal with issues of collaboration. Although collaboration is challenging, collaborative
                     development produces better software than any developer could produce alone. Unlike
                     previous work which focuses on the proposal and evaluation of models and tools to
                     support collaborative work, this paper presents an interview study aiming to understand
                     (i) the motivations, (ii) how collaboration happens, and (iii) the challenges and
                     barriers of collaborative software development. After interviewing twelve experienced

                  <p>Global Software Development has brought many benefits to the industry. On the other
                     hand, it carries with it new challenges mostly regarding knowledge transfer. When
                     new hires join a company, they should learn about the working process, organization
                     structure and company corporate culture. Therefore, companies should be adopting strategies
                     to manage and transfer knowledge to better support newcomers as well as to hire new
                     members to increase the developer team due to massive demand. As we work in GSD scope,
                     we use Wiki as an alternative for sharing knowledge and for helping newcomers learn
                     about our software development process. However, newer members reported great difficulty
                     during Wiki usage, due to a large amount of information, lack of information process
                     and non-structural knowledge sharing. For this reason, we surveyed to understand which
                     difficulties newer PLs members faced during wiki usage at Sidia R&amp;D Institute. The
                     results show important contributions to understand how their learning work process,
                     difficulties to access wiki information caused by usability issues and knowledge management

                     but there is still plenty of room for improvement.

                     months. We designed an onboarding programme within 3 months to help it do so efficaciously.
                     We wanted to optimize for: fast iterations in the programme rollout, to keep the 'flywheel
                     spinning' by reducing drag on current staff, rapid acceleration where new hires contributed
                     quickly, and smooth integration where new hires adapted to the engineering, company,
                     and country cultures.
                  </p> 
                  <p>To reduce drag we onboarded in cohorts and involved existing practitioners in the

                     we encouraged help and mentoring within and across cohorts.

                  <p>Sourcing the right IT engineers is critical for project success. In recent years,
                     two sourcing strategies have been grabbing attention: crowdsourcing and inner-sourcing.
                     Each has their own good points and bad points. Crowdsourcing allows organizations
                     to recruit IT engineers from outside on demand. However, organizations working on
                     closed-source code with confidential information might be worried about security concerns
                     (e.g., information leak). The other strategy, inner-sourcing, can make any IT engineer
                     in an organization become a member of all projects by adopting open source software
                     development practices. This improves the mobility of IT engineers between projects
                     inside the organization. However, there is a limit to the types of IT engineers that
                     one organization can have. In this report, we propose a hybrid sourcing approach.
                     It integrates the two sourcing strategies to develop software - crowdsourcing and
                     inner-sourcing. This approach distributes the development tasks to either software
                     crowdsourcing or inner-sourcing according to task type. As a case study, we adopt
                     hybrid sourcing approach for an industrial project. The project developed a web application
                     system for a bus company. We evaluate the effectiveness and future issues of hybrid
                     sourcing.

                  <p>Lately, crowdsourcing has emerged as a viable option of getting work done by leveraging
                     the collective intelligence of the crowd. With many tasks posted every day, the size
                     of crowdsourcing platforms is growing exponentially. Hence, workers face an important
                     challenge of selecting the right task. Despite the task filtering criteria available
                     on the platform to select the right task, crowd workers find it difficult to choose
                     the most relevant task and must glean through the filtered tasks to find the relevant
                     tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework for recommending tasks to workers. The
                     proposed framework evaluates the worker's fitment over the tasks based on worker's
                     preference, past tasks (s)he has performed, and tasks done by similar workers. We
                     evaluated our approach on the datasets collected from popular crowdsourcing platform.
                     Our experimental results based on 5,000 tasks and 3,000 workers show that the recommendation
                     made by our framework is significantly better as compared to the baseline approach.

                     Brazilian and global market. SIDIA has clients around the world, and one of them is
                     a mobile device manufacturer which embeds the Android operating system into such devices.
                     To sell smartphones in all desired countries, some regulations must be adhered to.
                     In Brazil and Colombia, one of the mandatory regulations by law is that every product
                     must contain a User Instruction Manual (UIM), which helps users to figure out distinctive
                     aspects and features of the product. Currently, the Android OS Version for mobile
                     devices commercialized in America (Latin mobile devices) and UIM are developed and
                     designed in cities from different states (Manaus, Amazonas - Campinas, S√£o Paulo)
                     from Brazil. Moreover, to design the UIM is necessary to have access to the physical
                     device, so it must be shipped across distant cities. Due to logistical problems and
                     bureaucracy in administrative processes, the device may take a long time to be delivered
                     and, consequently, may delay smartphone manufacturing, causing financial damage. This
                     experience report describes the lessons learned on developing and integrating a tool-based
                     approach that allows users to remotely access a device thereby solving the physical
                     device dependency problem and addressing specific requirements of the UIM development.

                  <p><em>Context</em>: Designing software is an activity in which software developers <em>think</em> and make design decisions that ultimately shape the structure and behavior of software
                     products. Currently, designing software is one of the least understood activities
                     in which software developers engage. In a collaborative design setting, distances
                     such as geographic, cultural, or social distance can lead to socio-technical challenges
                     that potentially affect the way software is designed.
                  </p> 
                  <p><em>Objective</em>: To contribute to an increased understanding of software design, we investigate how
                     geographic distance affects collaborative software design.
                  </p> 
                  <p><em>Method</em>: To this end, we conducted a multiple-case study exploring in depth the <em>design thinking</em> of co-located and distributed software developers in a collaborative design setting.
                  </p> 
                  <p><em>Results</em>: We find that, compared to co-located developers, distributed developers practice
                     less problem space exploration and focus instead more on the solution space. This
                     could be related to different socio-technical challenges caused by distributed collaboration,
                     such as lack of awareness and common understanding.
                  </p> 
                  <p><em>Conclusion</em>: Our findings contribute to an increased understanding as to how software design
                     is affected by geographic distance. Developers engaging in collaborative design need
                     to be aware that problem space exploration is reduced in a distributed setting, which

                  <p>Global Software Development (GSD) has been a trend as the software industry is experiencing
                     increasing commercial globalization. On the other hand, working with distributed teams
                     also face new difficulties and challenges, resulting from geographic separation such
                     as time zone, culture, and activities synchronism. Sidia is a R&amp;D Institute, located
                     in Manaus-Brazil, that develops innovative software solutions on Android Platform
                     in all Latin America. The institute works collaborating with Samsung Mobile Division,
                     located in South Korea, and external stakeholders provided by Mobile Network Operators
                     (MNO) from Latin America countries (e.g., Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru). For this reason,
                     to meet the demands of MNOs, Sidia works in GSD environment. In this context, the
                     project management process becomes difficult due to the coordination of many different
                     stakeholders in a distributed environment, such as tracking requirements, wrong releases,
                     tracking issues. To minimize these difficulties, we developed a tool to support our
                     project management process, called Release Manager (RM). This paper describes the
                     introduction of the RM Tool to improve management in distributed projects for the
                     Android Platform Update.

                  <p>In this experience report, we discuss the development of a solution that enables conflict-affected
                     youth to discover and access relevant learning content. A team of individuals from
                     a not-for-profit, a large multi-national technology company, and an academic institution,
                     collaborated to develop that solution as a conversational agent named Hakeem. We provide
                     a brief motivation and product description before outlining our design and development
                     process including forming a distributed virtual team, engaging in user-centred design
                     with conflict-affected youth in Lebanon, and using a minimum viable product approach
                     while adapting Scrum for distributed development. We end this report with a reflection
                     on the lessons learned thus far.

                  <p>The emergence of Global Software Development (GSD) has led to certain difficulties
                     in the life cycle of global projects, in addition to the traditional challenges of
                     collocated development, particularly as regards Project Management (PM). These difficulties
                     are caused by the geographical, linguistic and cultural distance among the members
                     of the team, signifying that the project manager requires special skills with which
                     to mitigate these issues. Bearing this in mind, this paper describes a serious game
                     (SG), denominated as GLOBAL-MANAGER, whose objective is to provide training in the
                     management of GSD projects. The game attempts to develop several skills in its players
                     whilst simultaneously providing them with an immersive, pleasant and attractive experience.
                     The skills developed are related to coordination, communication and control, which
                     are three of the principal challenges in GSD.
