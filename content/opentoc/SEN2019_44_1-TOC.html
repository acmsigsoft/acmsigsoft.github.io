                  <p>In every larger-scale endeavor, or at least in most larger-scale endeavors, there
                     comes a time to evaluate progress, solicit opinion, ask your public, survey your customers
                     -- in short, to find out if what you are doing is actually worth doing. In some cases,
                     this step may be omitted, or the results ignored: it is possible that if Herman Melville
                     had shown people Moby Dick when he was half-done with it, everyone except Nathaniel
                     Hawthorne would have said "Er, we're not sure what this is all about. Where's the
                     nice adventure of Omoo? Just what are you up to, Sir?" He should not have therefore
                     ditched the manuscript and gone on to something else; also, Nathaniel Hawthorne gets
                     50,000 votes. However, in general, you (and I) are not Melville writing Moby Dick.
                     Scientific projects tend to publish some papers before they are "complete" and if
                     these are universally derided and rejected, or receive no citations, it is often the
                     case that they are doing nothing of much interest. There are exceptions, but they
                     are rarer, perhaps, than we might think. Most things that are ignored are ignored
                     for a good reason.

                  <p>This is a good time as any to address the more philosophical questions of what software
                     is and how we use it, in particular software used as a replacement for human intelligence-AI.
                     My intent in this and in the next few columns is to address some of the fundamentals,
                     that is, the science of AI or what should be nailed-down before software engineering
                     begins. You get more traction when you design on a solid science base of knowledge.
                     A simple analogy, for example-one might not choose to labor over a not-quite-working
                     perpetual-motion machine if one were aware of the second law of thermodynamics. Then
                     again, there is no equivalent "law of human intelligence," so people keep trying.

                  <p>The continuous integration of software-intensive systems together with the ever-increasing
                     computing power offer a breeding ground for intelligent agents and multi-agent systems
                     (MAS) more than ever before. Over the past two decades, a wide variety of languages,
                     models, techniques and methodologies have been proposed to engineer agents and MAS.
                     Despite this substantial body of knowledge and expertise, the systematic engineering
                     of large-scale and open MAS still poses many challenges. Researchers and engineers
                     still face fundamental questions regarding theories, architectures, languages, processes,
                     and platforms for designing, implementing, running, maintaining, and evolving MAS.
                     This paper reports on the results of the 6th International Workshop on Engineering
                     Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS 2018, 14th-15th of July, 2018, Stockholm, Sweden), where
                     participants discussed the issues above focusing on the state of affairs and the road
                     ahead for researchers and engineers in this area.

                  <p>The RET (Requirements Engineering and Testing) workshop series provides a meeting
                     point for researchers and practitioners from the two separate elds of Requirements
                     Engineering (RE) and Testing. The goal is to improve the connection and alignment
                     of these two areas through an exchange of ideas, challenges, practices, experiences
                     and results. The long term aim is to build a community and a body of knowledge within
                     the intersection of RE and Testing, i.e. RET. The 5th workshop was held in colocation
                     with ICSE 2018 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The workshop continued in the same interactive
                     vein as the predecessors. We introduced a new format for the presentations in which
                     the paper authors had the opportunity to interact extensively with the audience. Each
                     author was supported by a member of the organization committee to prepare either an
                     extensive demo, collect more data in form of a questionnaire or perform a hands-on
                     tutorial. We named this new format \X-ray session". In order to create an RET knowledge
                     base, this cross-cutting area elicits contributions from both RE and Testing, and
                     from both researchers and practitioners. A range of papers were presented from short
                     positions papers to full research papers that cover connections between the two elds.
                     The workshop attracted 27 participants and the positive feedback on the new format
                     encourages us to organize the workshop the next year again.

                  <p>Generic Programming enables program constructs to be reused in a variety of situations.
                     In programming languages, idea of generic programming is being opted through a variety
                     of generic mechanisms. Generic mechanisms are either directly applied to pre-existing
                     language constructs or it provides its own components for generic implementation.
                     In this paper, we present such generic mechanisms in an organized way such that it
                     appears as "one mechanism intensify other". Our aim is to exhibit generic evolution
                     among mainstream object oriented programming languages (OOPLs). Hence, we analyze
                     such approaches for better expressiveness and type-safety of generic programming as
                     they evolved in OOPLs. This brief review article will help developers and researchers
                     to precisely understand the generic mechanism in mainstream OOPLs.

                     We envision Incide, an integrated development environment that allows a synergistic

                     concrete solution. This solution is then communicated to the editor of each programmer
                     as patches along with personalization on syntactic elements like choice of programming
                     language constructs and variable names. We believe that such editors will improve
                     productivity on complex solutions by bringing a discipline into combining the intuition
                     and intellect of multiple programmers.

                  <p>The continuous integration of software-intensive systems together with the ever-increasing
                     computing power offer a breeding ground for intelligent agents and multi-agent systems
                     (MAS) more than ever before. Over the past two decades, a wide variety of languages,
                     models, techniques and methodologies have been proposed to engineer agents and MAS.
                     Despite this substantial body of knowledge and expertise, the systematic engineering
                     of large-scale and open MAS still poses many challenges. Researchers and engineers
                     still face fundamental questions regarding theories, architectures, languages, processes,
                     and platforms for designing, implementing, running, maintaining, and evolving MAS.
                     This paper reports on the results of the 6th International Workshop on Engineering
                     Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS 2018, 14th-15th of July, 2018, Stockholm, Sweden), where
                     participants discussed the issues above focusing on the state of affairs and the road
                     ahead for researchers and engineers in this area.

                  <p>The RET (Requirements Engineering and Testing) workshop series provides a meeting
                     point for researchers and practitioners from the two separate fields of Requirements
                     Engineering (RE) and Testing. The goal is to improve the connection and alignment
                     of these two areas through an exchange of ideas, challenges, practices, experiences
                     and results. The long term aim is to build a community and a body of knowledge within
                     the intersection of RE and Testing, i.e. RET. The 5th workshop was held in colocation
                     with ICSE 2018 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The workshop continued in the same interactive
                     vein as the predecessors. We introduced a new format for the presentations in which
                     the paper authors had the opportunity to interact extensively with the audience. Each
                     author was supported by a member of the organization committee to prepare either an
                     extensive demo, collect more data in form of a questionnaire or perform a hands-on
                     tutorial. We named this new format \X-ray session". In order to create an RET knowledge
                     base, this crosscutting area elicits contributions from both RE and Testing, and from
                     both researchers and practitioners. A range of papers were presented from short positions
                     papers to full research papers that cover connections between the two fields. The
                     workshop attracted 27 participants and the positive feedback on the new format encourages
                     us to organize the workshop the next year again.

                  <p>Open source software development enabled distributed teams of programmers to contribute
                     to large software systems that became standards in the operation of government and
                     business. Crowdsourcing went further by enabling contributions in the form of small
                     and independent tasks. This allowed teams to scale from dozens to hundreds of people.
                     While crowdsourcing established as industry practice in the areas of software testing,
                     it is challenging for source code related tasks, e.g., software debugging. One of
                     the reasons is that the complex dependencies in the source code can make many tasks
                     difficult to partition and sequence, and later aggregate their outcomes. I am investigating
                     these problems in the context of failure resolution tasks. A failure resolution task
                     consists of inspecting the source code with the objective to identify and explain
                     the root-cause of a software failure. My approach partitions code inspection into
                     questions that are automatically instantiated from templates. I present here my research
                     plan and the early results of experiments on the efficacy, efficiency, and scalability
                     of my approach.

                     analysis of possibly the largest open source dataset through examining a population
                     of 15,000 projects and by including a sample of 4349 projects, where a main language
                     can be identified. The investigation, so far, has revealed considerable differences

                  <p>Software development is prone to software faults due to the involvement of multiple
                     stakeholders especially during the fuzzy phases (requirements and design). Software
                     inspections are commonly used in industry to detect and fix problems in requirements
                     and design artifacts thereby mitigating the fault propagation to later phases. The
                     requirements documented in natural language (NL) are prone to contain faults because
                     of different vocabularies among stakeholders. This research employs various NL processing
                     with semantic analysis (SA) and mining solutions from graph theory to NL requirements
                     to develop inter-related requirements (IRRs) that can help identify requirements that
                     may need similar fixes. Additionally, our approach aims at aiding requirements' engineers
                     with fault-prone regions both pre and post inspection. Pre-inspection, our approach
                     using IRRs help removing redundant and extraneous faults within related requirements
                     while post-inspection, it aids engineers analyse the impact of a change in one requirement
                     on another related requirements. So, this research aims at developing a graph of inter-related
                     requirements using natural language processing and semantic analysis approaches on
                     a given requirements document that can be used to aid various decisions pre and post-inspections.

                  <p>Context: Nowadays, there is of high interest to use automated testing, not only because
                     it optimizes the manual testing by reducing the needed time and cost, but also because
                     manual testing is more likely to produce errors. Increasing the safety of software
                     controlled complex systems, that use many distributed electronic controlled units,
                     requires extensive testing. In model based testing, the test specification is derived
                     from the system requirements and a model that describes selected functional and nonfunctional
                     aspects of the system under test.
