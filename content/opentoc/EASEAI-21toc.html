                  <p>Research on source code mining has been explored to discover interesting structural
                     regularities, API usage patterns, refactoring opportunities, bugs, crosscutting concerns,
                     code clones and systematic changes. In this paper we present a pattern mining algorithm
                     that uses frequent tree mining to mine for interesting good, bad or ugly coding idioms
                     made by undergraduate students taking an introductory programming course. We do so
                     by looking for patterns that distinguish positive examples, corresponding to the more
                     correct answers to a question, from negative examples, corresponding to solutions
                     that failed the question. We report promising initial results of this algorithm applied
                     to the source code of over 500 students. Even though more work is needed to fine-tune
                     and validate the algorithm further, we hope that it can lead to interesting insights
                     that can eventually be integrated into an intelligent recommendation system to help
                     students learn from their errors.</p>

                  <p>Acquiring soft and project skills during their studies is of paramount importance
                     for computer science students to integrate large development teams after graduating.
                     Project-oriented learning offers interesting opportunities for teachers to tutor students,
                     and allows them to acquire and train those skills in addition to the core topics of
                     the course. However, since most existing curricula require courses to be as independent
                     as possible (for organizational reasons for instance), some topics are covered in
                     different courses in slightly different ways. This repetition is interesting for understanding
                     difficult notions appropriately, but may also hamper students' understanding when
                     closely related concepts are embedded in different ways. We report here on our teaching
                     approach: we propose a series of projects that share a common theme, in order to (i)
                     provide a transversal understanding of common notions seen in separate courses, and
                     (ii) introduce soft and project skills in a progressive way, enabling students to
                     iteratively experience and learn skills that are necessary for professional life.
                     We report on the results of interviews conducted with the students and extract valuable
                     lessons for reproducing this approach in different curricula.</p>

                  <p>Software systems become increasingly complex and testing is a vital component of the
                     development process. Teaching software testing concepts are now more than ever acknowledged
                     as essential. </p> 
                  <p> The aim of this paper is to report on our software testing teaching approach, using
                     game-based activities to engage students and facilitate learning, making them aware
                     of their actions and related testing concepts. Agile testing and Session-Based Test
                     Management are learned through lego-based context, exploratory testing is learned
                     through a dice-based game, and various testing concepts are learned during the laboratory
                     using storification. </p> 
                  <p> We report on the results of activities with students, extracting valuable lessons
                     for reproducing this approach in teaching software testing: game-based learning motivated
                     students to participate in the activities, reflection on their actions allowed them
                     to self-discover the testing concepts encapsulated into the game. In addition, we

                  <p>Computer science studies are more and more popular, and teachers must face and adapt
                     to the increasing number of students. Whereas small groups allowed more interactions
                     between teachers and students, the resulting overcrowding takes away closeness and
                     forces teachers to spend less time with each student. Therefore, the student can quickly
                     feel submerged and helpless against the difficulty of the course. This paper proposes
                     a solution that aims to reduce drop-out in programming courses. It offers an accurate
                     feedback on the quality of students' Python code to deepen their understanding, together
                     with a playful interface to boost their interest in programming. This solution developed
                     under the name of "METAssistant" has two objectives. It allows students to use it

                  <p>Nowadays, when the changes that appear in programming paradigms and in software process
                     development methodologies are extremely frequent, teaching a Software Engineering
                     related course has become a demanding task. To all these are added changes caused
                     by the dynamics of the society and the traits of the current learners and how they
                     learn. </p> 
                  <p>To cope with the challenges mentioned above, the paper proposes a complementary method
                     for Project Based Learning in teaching two Software Engineering related courses, at
                     undergraduate and master level at Babeş-Bolyai University. Its contribution is twofold:
                     firstly, it frames a new pedagogical approach based on “Students Generating Questions”
                     as a learning strategy, defined in a collaborative way. The approach is supported
                     by an e-learning platform designed as smart learning environment. Secondly, it investigates
                     through a quantitative and qualitative analysis, the students perceptions, their feedback
                     and learning experiences on the use of applying this learning method. </p> 
                  <p>The results of the survey indicate that the proposed learning method helped students
                     to better regulate their learning and to achieve their goals. It also revealed some
                     advantages reported by the students such as reduction of test anxiety, productive
                     collaborative learning and the creation of a question bank which represents a consistent
                     and comprehensive material for training during the semester and for their exam preparation.</p>

                  <p>In the past few years, we have made several pedagogical changes to the way we teach
                     and assess student knowledge in our courses.These courses are undergraduate software
                     engineering courses taken in the third or fourth years, and graduate (non-research)
                     courses taken as part of a master’s degree. They are taken by software engineering
                     majors and computer science majors. This paper focuses on a specific technique–allowing
                     students to retake weekly quizzes.We use weekly quizzes to offer more frequent, yet
                     lower stakes,assessments than the traditional midterm exam. Quizzes are usually given
                     at the beginning of class meetings. We offer students who under-performed or who missed
                     a quiz the chance to try again. A major contribution of this paper is a description
                     of scheduling soft-ware we developed to facilitate the retake process. Retake quizzes
                     are different from the original quizzes, but cover the same material and are of similar
                     difficulty. Our goal is to improve student learning and retention. This paper presents
                     a post-hoc retrospective analysis of student performance on retake quizzes. In such
                     a scenario, only limited conclusions can be drawn. Nonetheless, we see encouraging
                     signs that students not only achieve higher overall scores when retaking quizzes,
                     but that some students perform better on the final exam.</p>

                  <p>Authentic undergraduate research experiences have been shown to be very effective
                     at sustaining students’ learning motivation and enhancing students’ theoretical knowledge
                     and practical skills. However, there still exists some common challenges in undergraduate
                     research. In this paper, we describe an approach that offers undergraduate students
                     authentic and immersive research experience focusing on applied machine learning for
                     software engineering and discuss our experiences with example undergraduate research
                     projects and outcomes. A survey was designed to assess students’ overall experience
                     of participating in authentic undergraduate research projects in machine learning
                     for software engineering. Preliminary results from this survey are provided.</p>

                  <p>This report presents observations from two semesters of the same course, Software
                     Testing, within the same department, in different school years. The first semester,
                     Fall 2019, was the last semester completely in-person before the COVID-19 pandemic
                     made it so that our courses changed to a virtual setting. The second semester, Spring
                     2021, is the most recent virtual semester at the time that this report is being written
                     (in May of 2021). Though the course was modified to some extent for the purpose of
                     it being online, we had a goal for it to remain largely the same. In both versions
                     of the course, there was a heavy emphasis on interactive exercises as a means to increase
                     engagement and performance within the class and in regards to software testing as
                     a whole. The virtual semester gave us an opportunity to try out a variety of new avenues
                     of learning and an exercise in trying to keep consistency from an in-person environment
                     to a virtual one. This report will address added benefits of the virtual settings,
                     consistencies that we managed to maintain throughout the transition, and lost exercises
                     from the course along with ideas of how to mitigate the loss in any future virtual
                     semesters. It will also address feedback from a survey given to students as we consider
                     the results of the semesters.</p>
