<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Pair Programming<sup>1</sup> has quickly become a widespread technique for teams adopting Agile. The interest has gained even more popularity for those implementing Extreme Programming (XP) which is a well-known Agile methodology. There is a general agreement that pair programming works well with a pair of developers working side by side. However, that is not always possible. Distributed teams and distributed team members are becoming the norm. With that said, is distributed pair programming possible? And if so, can it be done effectively? This paper examines a project where distributed pair programming was extremely effective. Contrary to agile dogma, some individuals may perform better in a distributed manner over collocated.</p></div> </div>

Traditional Control Based Project Management Methodologies (TCBPMM) prevents change, by extensive planning before system is developed. The industry always demands for project management methodologies with the ability to adapt to changing needs of the users.</p> <p>The paper focuses mainly on how we in SIEMENS setup agile approach with technical excellence and an objective to create T shaped teams, involving transformation from control based to self-organizing work culture. Also it mentions the encountered barriers like change resistance, delay in adapt, ambiguities, unidirectional thoughts, misconceptions, lack of coordination.</p> <p>The team followed the principle "Happy team produces great work". A Project Manager of a team works as "servant leader" enabling the team to perform to its fullest potential. The main goal of the project manager is team empowerment, efficient process with a look towards continuous improvement that satisfies both team &#38; customer. A work agreement was set with core work points of Guiding, Coaching, Collaboration and Team based ownership. We aimed to create an environment of provide and seek constructive feedback on a regular basis, respect for every individuals is key, Embrace Transparency, Team-Shared leadership &#38; recognize good work.</p></div> </div>

In early 2014 Stack Overflow em Portugu&ecirc;s (SO-PT) was announced with the goal to reach developers that are not sufficiently proficient in the English language to fully participate in SO. Almost four years later we study how the simultaneous availability of SO and SO-PT impacted Brazilian software developers. A priori, the impact could have been either empowering or impeding. To address this question, we combine interviews, analysis of trace data from SO and SO-PT and a survey of 229 Brazilian software developers. Our results indicate that the developers recognize availability of the information, response speed and accessibility as strong points of SO, and lower barrier to entry and presence of Brazilian-specific information as strong points of SO-PT. In large, SO remains more popular than SO-PT, and SO-PT is not perceived as a viable alternative to SO.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Proprietary enterprise software is commonly embedded in multinational organizations and therefore has multiple sources of global or local demand. This type of software is subject to constant evolutions motivated by improvements in the features or by changes in the legal and economic context of its environment. Problems arising from the demand for requirements are associated with the suitability of a particular local requirement to its global context, for example: tax rules are characteristic of a specific country while a business rule can achieve every global structure. In addition, software customization can be implemented by the software producer, external partners, programmers allocated within the customer company, and so on. The coordination of this scenario is considered critical for the productive sector company that uses proprietary enterprise software. If the software does not evolve, the company processes can be temporarily compromised, and the software becomes obsolete. We report a case study of a large proprietary ERP system in a multinational company located in Brazil that is among the three largest exporters in its market segment. As a contribution, we present the current structure of the distributed evolution process of the software in question and how the stakeholder coordination of this scenario occurs.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Today it is very common for software systems to be built by teams located in more than one country. For example, a project team may be located in the US while the team lead resides in Sweden. How then should students be trained for this kind of work? Senior design or capstone projects offer students real-world hands-on experience but rarely while working internationally. One reason is that most instructors do not have international business contacts that allow them to find project sponsors in other countries. Another reason is the fear of having to invest a huge amount of time managing an international project. In this paper we present the general concepts related to "International Capstone Project Exchanges", the basic model behind the exchanges (student teams are led by an industry sponsor residing in a different country) and several alternate models that have been used in practice. We will give examples from projects in the US, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and Colombia. We have extended the model beyond software projects to include engineering projects as well as marketing, and journalism. We conclude with a description of an International Capstone Project Exchange website that we have developed to aid any university in establishing their own international project exchange.</p></div> </div>

In this study, we investigate how a major Australia-based multi-site global software vendor transitioned from a structured to a Scaled Agile approach.</p> <p>We demonstrate how practices and roles in a distributed software vendor evolved over time across the organisation in an on-going process of their global agile transformation. Through this elaboration, we identify three major agile transitions and the contribution of a scaled agile approach in the building of market driven capabilities. We theorised a relationship between increased dynamic capabilities of the firm and a scaled agile transition. Supporting our view, we noted that agile practices and roles across the organisation contributed as expected to improved internal process capability. More surprisingly, they were also found to increase our vendor's ability both to identify and take advantage of opportunities and to innovate in global product and service development and delivery.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Follow-the-sun has evolved to follow-the-talent. Managing a product thus has a true global perspective. Products increasingly are developed in virtual teams using agile set-up and gig economy practices. The success of a product or service depends on its product management. Recently software product management has moved closer to software development in its understanding that market decisions have technical impact, and vice versa. This research provides results from an empirical field study with twenty companies on software product management in its global context. The empirical study provides concrete practices to fertilize and evolve software product management in global teams and thus the success of products in terms of predictability, quality and efficiency. We show that with institutionalization of a consistent and empowered product management role, global product development benefits in terms of schedule, quality and duration.</p></div> </div>

Interestingly, in-house sites (regardless of location) do not suffer such high levels of staff turnover.</p> <p>We want to understand the factors affecting employee retention in-house and offshore outsourced settings, to better understand the potential impact of staff turnover on global software development.</p> <p>We employed a mixed-method approach comprising two empirical case studies in industry involving 62 practitioners at three global companies conducting in-house and offshore outsourced software development. We collected practitioner perceptions of causal factors for employee retention and performed a cross-case analysis to triangulate our findings.</p> <p>Practitioners cited employment policies, work-life balance, workplace innovation, product quality, alignment of offshore work hours with onshore, long working hours and adverse impact on health as factors affecting staff retention. In-house offshore have more family friendly employment policies. In the outsourcing sector, the focus on customer satisfaction sometimes leads to less attractive work patterns.</p> <p>Offshore outsourcing service providers could improve development team member retention by improving work-life balance and adopting family friendly employment policies.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Large-scale distributed projects are typically the results of collective efforts performed by multiple developers, each one having a different personality. The study of developers' personalities has the potential of explaining their' behavior in various contexts. For example, the propensity to trust others, a critical factor to the success of global software engineering - has been found to influence positively the result of code reviews in distributed projects.</p> <p>In this paper, we perform a quantitative analysis of developers' personality in open source software projects, intended as an extreme form of distributed projects in which no single organization controls the project. We mine ecosystem-level data from the code commits and email messages contributed by the developers working on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects, as representative of large scale-distributed projects.</p> <p>We find that developers become over time more conscientious, agreeable, and neurotic. Moreover, personality traits do not vary with their role, membership, and extent of contribution to the projects. We also find evidence that more open and more agreeable developers are more likely to become project contributors.<sup>1</sup></p></div> </div>

Due to this tension, practices are either modified or added to compensate with the additional control required by the setup. In this paper, we present a case study about a company that managed to incrementally design a process that does not compromise the foundations of the agile philosophy by embracing the characteristics of distributed development. We show how a virtual work environment has been crafted by continuously improving practices and carefully selecting technologies to allow each team member to fully participate regardless of the actual physical location. Aware of the single nature limitation of the reported case, we present extensive information to frame the context allowing meaningful comparisons by researchers and providing concrete examples for practitioners.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Global software engineering education is steadily advancing to fully prepare students for future challenges at work, by providing opportunities for real-life experiences, especially in distributed project-based courses. These international student teams are, as in real companies, susceptible to various risks stemming from different internal and external factors, being the sources of stress and impacting team resilience.</p> <p>In this paper, we focus on studying the resilience of teams affected by two adversities specific to project team composition and project dynamics. The first, internal one, is the teams' ability to compensate for the missing efforts of its non-contributing members in a distributed project environment. The second, external, is the ability to cope with changes of customer requirements, which can be real, or just perceived by the team members.</p> <p>Based on the empirical data, acquired from a number of Distributed Software Development course instances, we identify different sub-factors of these two risks and analyze the correlations of these elements to the final project evaluations, more specifically on the evaluation of both the final product and project process.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Software security is an important aspect that needs to be considered during the entire software development life cycle (SDLC). Integrating software security at each phase of SDLC has become an urgent need. To address software security, various approaches, techniques, methods, practices, and models have been proposed and developed. However, recent research shows that many software development methodologies do not explicitly include methods for incorporating software security during the development of software as it evolves from requirements engineering to its final disposal. The primary objective of this research is to study the state-of-the-art of security in the context of SDLC by following systematic mapping study (SMS). In the second phase, we will identify, through systematic literature review (SLR) and empirical study in the industry, the software security contributions, security challenges and their practices for global software development (GSD) vendors. The ultimate aim is to develop a Software Security Assurance Model (SSAM) to assist GSD vendor organisations in measuring their readiness towards the development of secure software.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>There has been a tremendous increase in the rate of agile method adoption across large and globally distributed large organizations. Despite of several challenges, organizations have shown profound interest due to the potential benefits of agile at small scale. Several scaling frameworks and scaling practices have been proposed by the consultants and practitioners to support globally distributed large scale agile transformations. The present research has 3 dimensions: (i) scaling practices (ii) scaling frameworks (iii) enterprise agile. Various research methods have been adopted in the study to address the these dimensions. This would help agile practitioners and consultants to reflect on the scaling approaches and help them during the agile transformation process across large and globally distributed large organizations.</p></div> </div>

<div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Context: Communication plays an essential role in the professional software development, as it stands as one of the pillars of this collaborative activity. Communication is also one of the leading challenges in Distributed Software Development (DSD) teams, which may be hindered by this business model. Still, little is known about how communication occurs in this specific context. Objective: This work aims to present a doctoral research proposal for studying communication in DSD teams to propose a new theory, and thereby, establish a theoretical base for future studies. Additionally, to stimulate discussions about the relevance of this proposal. Method: I propose Grounded Theory research. Results: To help in the consolidation of this study gap, I present the preliminary results of a non-extensive literature review. Conclusions: Based on preliminary findings, I conclude that a new, and specific communication theory in DSD may have its place in literature.</p></div> </div>
