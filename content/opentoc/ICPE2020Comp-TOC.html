                  <p>Inference is the production stage of machine learning workflow in which a trained
                     model is used to infer or predict with real world data. A recommendation system improves
                     customer experience by displaying most relevant items based on historical behavior
                     of a customer. Machine learning models built for recommendation systems are deployed
                     either on-premise or migrated to a cloud for inference in real time or batch. A recommendation
                     system should be cost effective while honoring service level agreements (SLAs). In
                     this work we discuss on-premise implementation of our recommendation system called
                     iPrescribe. We show a methodology to migrate on-premise implementation of recommendation
                     system to a cloud using ML workflow. We also present our study on performance of recommendation
                     system model when deployed on different types of virtual instances.

                  <p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you to WOSP-C 2020, the Workshop on Challenges
                     and Opportunities in Large Scale Performance. Our theme this year relates to the use
                     of analytics to interpret system performance and resource usage measurements that
                     can now be gathered rapidly on a large scale. Our four invited speakers hail from
                     industry. All three presentations in the first session and the last presentation in
                     the second session deal with modeling and measurement to automate the making of decisions
                     about system configuration or the recognition of anomalies, especially for cloud-based
                     systems. The other two papers in the second session address measurement and modeling
                     issues at a granular level. These topics are highly relevant to the issues systems
                     architects and other stakeholders face when deploying systems in the cloud, because
                     doing so need not guarantee good performance. The recent emergence of the ability
                     to gather vast numbers of performance and resource usage measurements facilitates
                     the informed choice of target cloud platforms and their configurations. The presentations
                     in this workshop deal with various aspects of how this can be achieved.

                  <p>In this extended abstract, we provide an outline of the presentation planned for WOSP-C
                     2020. The goal of the presentation is to provide an overview of the challenges and
                     approaches for automated scalability assessment in the context of DevOps and microservices.
                     The focus of this presentation is on approaches that employ automated identification
                     of performance problems because these approaches can leverage performance anti-pattern[5]
                     detection technology. In addition, we envision extending the approach to recommend
                     component refactoring. In our previous work[1,2] we have designed a methodology and
                     associated tool support for the automated scalability assessment of micro-service
                     architectures, which included the automation of all the steps required for scalability
                     assessment. The presentation starts with an introduction to dependability, operational
                     Profile Data, and DevOps. Specifically, we provide an overview of the state of the
                     art in continuous performance monitoring technologies[4] that are used for obtaining
                     operational profile data using APM tools. We then present an overview of selected
                     approaches for production and performance testing based on the application monitoring
                     tool (PPTAM) as introduced in [1,2]. The presentation concludes by outlining a vision
                     for automated performance anti-pattern[5] detection. Specifically, we present the
                     approach introduced for automated anti-pattern detection based on load testing results
                     and profiling introduced in[6] and provide recommendations for future research.

                  <p>This report is prompted by some recent experience with building performance models
                     from kernel traces recorded by LTTng, a tracer that is part of Linux, and by observing
                     other researchers who are analyzing performance issues directly from the traces. It
                     briefly distinguishes the scope of the two approaches, regarding the model as an abstraction
                     of the trace, and the model-building as a form of machine learning. For model building
                     it then discusses how various limitations of the kernel trace information limit the
                     model and its capabilities and how the limitations might be overcome by using additional
                     information of different kinds. The overall perspective is a tradeoff between effort
                     and model capability.

                  <p>Organizations want to take advantage of the flexibility and scalability of Cloud platforms.
                     By migrating to the Cloud, they hope to develop and implement new applications faster
                     with lower cost. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM, Oracle and others Cloud
                     providers support different DBMS like Snowflake, Redshift, Teradata Vantage, and others.
                     These platforms have different architectures, mechanisms of allocation and management
                     of resources, and levels of sophistication of DBMS optimizers which affect performance,
                     scalability and cost. As a result, the response time, CPU Service Time and the number
                     of I/Os for the same query, accessing the similar table in the Cloud could be significantly
                     different than On Prem. In order to select the appropriate Cloud platform as a first
                     step we perform a Workload Characterization for On Prem Data Warehouse. Each Data
                     Warehouse workload represents a specific line of business and includes activity of
                     many users generating concurrently simple and complex queries accessing data from
                     different tables. Each workload has different demands for resources and different
                     Response Time and Throughput Service Level Goals. In this presentation we will review
                     results of the workload characterization for an On Prem Data Warehouse environment.
                     During the second step we collected measurement data for standard TPC-DS benchmark
                     tests performed in AWS Vantage, Redshift and Snowflake Cloud platform for different
                     sizes of the data sets and different number of concurrent users. During the third
                     step we used the results of the workload characterization and measurement data collected
                     during the benchmark to modify BEZNext On Prem Closed Queueing model to model individual
                     Clouds. And finally, during the fourth step we used our Model to take into consideration
                     differences in concurrency, priorities and resource allocation to different workloads.
                     BEZNext optimization algorithms incorporating Graduate search mechanism are used to
                     find the AWS instance type and minimum number of instances which will be required
                     to meet SLGs for each of the workloads. Publicly available information about the cost
                     of the different AWS instances is used to predict the cost of supporting workloads
                     in the Cloud month by month during next 12 months.

                  <p>Interesting approaches to counteract performance variability within cloud datacenters
                     include sending multiple request clones, either immediately or after a specified waiting
                     time. In this paper we present a performance model of cloud applications that utilize
                     the latter concept, known as speculative execution. We study the popular Join-Shortest-Queue
                     load-balancing strategy under the processor sharing queuing discipline. Utilizing
                     the near-synchronized service property of this setting, we model speculative execution
                     using a simplified synchronized service model. Our model is approximate, but accurate
                     enough to be useful even for high utilization scenarios. Furthermore, the model is
                     valid for any, possibly empirical, inter-arrival and service time distributions. We
                     present preliminary simulation results, showing the promise of our proposed model.

                  <p>Serverless computing is steadily becoming the implementation paradigm of choice for
                     a variety of applications, from data analytics to web applications, as it addresses
                     the main problems with serverfull and monolithic architecture. In particular, it abstracts
                     away resource provisioning and infrastructure management, enabling developers to focus
                     on the logic of the program instead of worrying about resource management which will
                     be handled by cloud providers. In this paper, we consider a document processing system
                     used in FinTech as a case study and describe the migration journey from a monolithic
                     architecture to a serverless architecture. Our evaluation results show that the serverless
                     implementation significantly improves performance while resulting in only a marginal
                     increase in cost.

                  <p>Serverless computing services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), hold the attractive
                     promise of a high level of abstraction and high performance, combined with the minimization
                     of operational logic. Several large ecosystems of serverless platforms, both open-
                     and closed-source, aim to realize this promise. Consequently, a lucrative market has
                     emerged. However, the performance trade-offs of these systems are not well-understood.
                     Moreover, it is exactly the high level of abstraction and the opaqueness of the operational-side
                     that make performance evaluation studies of serverless platforms challenging. Learning
                     from the history of IT platforms, we argue that a benchmark for serverless platforms
                     could help address this challenge. We envision a comprehensive serverless benchmark,
                     which we contrast to the narrow focus of prior work in this area. We argue that a
                     comprehensive benchmark will need to take into account more than just runtime overhead,
                     and include notions of cost, realistic workloads, more (open-source) platforms, and
                     cloud integrations. Finally, we show through preliminary real-world experiments how
                     such a benchmark can help compare the performance overhead when running a serverless
                     workload on state-of-the-art platforms.

                  <p>Fog computing has been regarded as an ideal platform for distributed and diverse IoT
                     applications. Fog environment consists of a network of fog nodes and IoT applications
                     are composed of containerized microservices communicating with each other. Distribution
                     and optimization of containerized IoT applications in the fog environment is a recent
                     line of research. Our work took Kubernetes as an orchestrator that instantiates, manages,
                     and terminates containers in multiple-host environments for IoT applications, where
                     each host acts as a fog node. This paper demonstrates the industrial feasibility and
                     practicality of deploying and managing containerized IoT applications on real devices
                     (raspberry pis and PCs) by utilizing commercial software tools (Docker, WeaveNet).
                     The demonstration will show that the application's functionality is not affected by
                     the distribution of communicating microservices on different nodes.

                  <p>General matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a critical operation in many application
                     domains [1]. It is a central building block of deep learning algorithms, computer
                     graphics operations, and other linear algebra dominated applications. Due to this,
                     GEMM has been extensively studied and optimized, resulting in libraries of exceptional
                     quality such as BLAS, Eigen, and other platform specific implementations such as MKL
                     (Intel) and ESSL (IBM) [2,3]. Despite these successes, the GeMM idiom continues to
                     be re-implemented by programmers, without consideration for the intricacies already
                     accounted for by the aforementioned libraries. To this end, this project aims to provide
                     transparent adoption of high-performance implementations of GEMM through a novel optimization
                     pass implemented within the LLVM framework using idiom recognition techniques[4].
                     Sub-optimal implementations of GEMM are replaced by equivalent library calls.

                     the actual server equipment and the software themselves must become more energy-efficient.

                  <p>Software developers use collection data structures extensively and are often faced
                     with the task of picking which collection to use. Choosing an inappropriate collection
                     can have major negative impact on runtime performance. However, choosing the right
                     collection can be difficult since developers are faced with many possibilities, which
                     often appear functionally equivalent. One approach to assist developers in this decision-making
                     process is to micro-benchmark data-structures in order to provide performance insights.
                     In this paper, we present results from experiments on Java collections (maps, lists,
                     and sets) using our tool JBrainy, which synthesises micro-benchmarks with sequences
                     of random method calls. We compare our results to the results of a previous experiment
                     on Java collections that uses a micro-benchmarking approach focused on single methods.
                     Our results support previous results for lists, in that we found ArrayList to yield
                     the best running time in 90% of our benchmarks. For sets, we found LinkedHashSet to
                     yield the best performance in 78% of the benchmarks. In contrast to previous results,
                     we found TreeMap and LinkedHashMap to yield better runtime performance than HashMap
                     in 84% of cases.

                  <p>Microservices and serverless functions are becoming integral parts of modern cloud-based
                     applications. Tailored performance engineering is needed for assuring that the applications
                     meet their requirements for quality attributes such as timeliness, resource efficiency,
                     and elasticity. A novel DevOps-based framework for developing microservices and serverless

                     engineering by including novel approaches for modeling, deployment optimization, testing,
                     and runtime management. This paper summarizes the contents of our tutorial presented

                     analysis, machine learning and deep learning on data to build prediction models. Solution
                     architects, engineers and researchers may use open-source technology or proprietary

                     data pre-processing time, model training time and model inference time. We do not
                     see a single benchmark answering all questions of solution architects and researchers.
