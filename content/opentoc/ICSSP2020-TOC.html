                  <p>Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly popular with organizations due to
                     the success of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. Using these techniques,
                     data scientists learn from vast amounts of data to enhance behaviour in software-intensive
                     systems. Despite the attractiveness of these techniques, however, there is a lack
                     of systematic and structured design process for developing ML/DL models. The study
                     uses a multiple-case study approach to explore the different activities and challenges
                     data scientists face when developing ML/DL models in software-intensive embedded systems.
                     In addition, we have identified seven different phases in the proposed design process
                     leading to effective model development based on the case study. Iterations identified
                     between phases and events which trigger these iterations optimize the design process
                     for ML/DL models. Lessons learned from this study allow data scientists and engineers
                     to develop high-performance ML/DL models and also bridge the gap between high demand
                     and low supply of data scientists.

                  <p>In the field of safety-critical systems, manual reviews are important to ensure high-quality
                     software and to satisfy legal obligations. When applying model-based engineering approaches,
                     no longer are only textual requirements specifications or software code under review,
                     but also model-based specification artifacts like behavioral requirements models.
                     As such behavioral specifications are typically documented on a type-level, errors
                     concerning the interactions between multiple system instances can go unnoticed in
                     manual reviews. This is particularly the case when multiple system instances of the
                     same system type are interacting during runtime, which is typical for cyber-physical
                     systems where networks of cyber-physical systems form dynamically to fulfill an overall
                     purpose. In this paper, we report on a controlled experiment whose results indicate
                     that instance-level review diagrams have -- compared to type-level diagrams - important
                     positive effects on reviewing processes for behavioral specifications of cyber-physical
                     systems. Specifically, the experiment provides empirical evidence that instance-level
                     review diagrams are significantly more expressive and effective than type-level diagrams.

                  <p>Software quality has become the lever of differentiation in today's competitive marketplace.
                     Quality at speed is the customer demand and automation is the biggest bottleneck holding
                     the evolution of quality function. Increased levels of automation and intelligence
                     in software engineering are the emerging trends across the IT field. As systems and
                     software processes guide the life cycle activities and are the vehicles for building
                     quality, it is necessary to look at the process infrastructure for the extent of process
                     automation support provided and the digital enablement. This paper maps out the existing
                     process infrastructure support in industry practice and proposes a roadmap for digital
                     re-imagination of software and systems processes. Harmonizing the quality engineering
                     themes with digital technologies, we propose a framework for building an intelligent
                     software process infrastructure, iSPIN that can help in digital re-imagination of
                     software and systems lifecycle processes. The framework has been implemented using
                     digital technologies and has been piloted with one of the industry business unit for
                     re-imagination of "proposal process". The proposed iSPIN framework will help in unprecedented
                     automation and quality engineering at each process step and paves the way towards
                     realizing the dictums of "Quality at Speed" and "Digital transformation of Software

                  <p>Textual user stories capture interactions of users with the system as high-level requirements.
                     However, user stories are typically rather short and backlogs can include many stories.
                     This makes it hard to (a) maintain user stories and backlogs, (b) fully understand
                     the scope of a software project without a detailed analysis of the backlog, and (c)
                     analyse how user stories impact design decisions during sprint planning and implementation.
                     This paper proposes a technique to automatically transform textual user stories into
                     visual use case scenarios in the form of robustness diagrams (a semi-formal scenario-based
                     visualisation of workflows). In addition to creating diagrams for individual stories,
                     the technique allows combining diagrams of multiple stories into one diagram to visualise
                     workflows within sets of stories (e.g., a backlog). Moreover, the technique supports
                     "viewpoint-based" diagrams, i.e., diagrams that show relationships between actors,
                     domain entities and user interfaces starting from a diagram element (e.g., an actor)
                     selected by the analyst. The technique utilises natural language processing and rule-based
                     transformations. We evaluated the technique with more than 1,400 user stories from
                     22 backlogs and show that (a) the technique generates syntactically valid robustness
                     diagrams, and (b) the quality of automatically generated robustness diagrams compares
                     to the quality of diagrams created by human experts, but depends on the quality of
                     the textual user stories.

                  <p>Microservice architecture has been recognized as an important enabler for continuous
                     development of many cloud-based systems. Code generation has been tried in the tool
                     chain of building microservices. However, most existing tools generally do not consider
                     the risks from continuous development.
                  </p> 
                  <p>We have been developing a toolkit which generates microservices from application domain
                     models. Our approach aligns development process to this toolkit and coordinates domain
                     modeling activity over project life cycles. In this paper, we describe its framework
                     and corresponding development process which eliminates delays brought by the uncertainty
                     of a project at a relatively early stage. Several minimum viable products have been
                     built upon the proposed approach during the past years, including automated generation
                     of code from domain decomposition. Our result shows 10% saving of effort and fewer
                     issues. Effort saving increases to 30% under an extreme condition with high-rate personnel
                     turnover. We also discuss our findings on running these projects and raise discussion

                  <p>Large-scale system development companies are increasingly adopting agile methods.
                     While this adoption may improve lead-times, such companies need to balance two trade-offs:
                     (i) the need to have a uniform, consistent development method on system level with
                     the need for specialised methods for teams in different disciplines (e.g., hardware,
                     software, mechanics, sales, support); (ii) the need for comprehensive documentation
                     on system level with the need to have lightweight documentation enabling iterative
                     and agile work. With specialised methods for teams, isolated teams work within larger
                     ecosystems of plan-driven culture, i.e., teams become agile "islands". At the boundaries,
                     these teams share knowledge which needs to be managed well for a correct system to
                     be developed. While it is useful to support diverse and specialised methods, it is
                     important to understand which islands are repeatedly encountered, the reasons or factors
                     triggering their existence, and how best to handle coordination between them. Based
                     on a multiple case study, this work presents a catalogue of islands and the boundary
                     objects between them. We believe this work will be beneficial to practitioners aiming
                     to understand their ecosystems and researchers addressing communication and coordination
                     challenges in large-scale development.

                  <p>Selecting a suitable development method for a specific project context is one of the
                     most challenging activities in process design. Every project is unique and, thus,
                     many context factors have to be considered. Recent research took some initial steps
                     towards statistically constructing hybrid development methods, yet, paid little attention
                     to the peculiarities of context factors influencing method and practice selection.
                     In this paper, we utilize exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression analysis
                     to learn such context factors and to identify methods that are correlated with these
                     factors. Our analysis is based on 829 data points from the HELENA dataset. We provide
                     five base clusters of methods consisting of up to 10 methods that lay the foundation
                     for devising hybrid development methods. The analysis of the five clusters using trained
                     models reveals only a few context factors, e.g., project/product size and target application
                     domain, that seem to significantly influence the selection of methods. An extended
                     descriptive analysis of these practices in the context of the identified method clusters
                     also suggests a consolidation of the relevant practice sets used in specific project
                     contexts.

                  <p>Human, social, organizational, and technical aspects are intertwined with each other
                     in software teams during the software development process. Practices that teams actually
                     adopt often deviate from those of the used frameworks, such as Scrum. However, currently
                     there is little empirical insight explaining typical deviations, including their reasons
                     and consequences. In this paper we use observations to investigate selected activities
                     of the software development process in two companies that use Scrum. We study identified
                     deviations to understand their reasons and consequences, using a survey and interviews.
                     We identify 13 deviations and we categorize reasons based on type. The deviations'
                     consequences are investigated in terms of their impact. Most deviations can be found
                     in multiple teams. Reasons are doubts of the teams, organizational structures and
                     complexity of the work. Consequences of deviations affect product development and
                     team work.

                  <p>Organizational factors such as team structure, coordination among engineers, or processes
                     have a significant impact on software quality and development progress. Projects often
                     take much longer to complete than planned and miscommunications among engineers are
                     common. Yet, the process for exploring the project-specific or organization-specific
                     root causes why this happens is still poorly supported. Investigations are cumbersome
                     and require significant effort. In the context of this industrial case study, our
                     industry partner was interested in measuring and assessing how the organization structure
                     and issue handling processes ultimately affected software quality and time. Reducing
                     the effort of such investigations/retrospectives and speeding up fact finding is important
                     as it allows for more frequent, informed engineering process improvements and feedback
                     to managers, team leads, and engineers. This paper describes our approach of pairing
                     process metrics with visual historical inspection of issues. Stakeholders such as
                     managers, team leads, or quality assurance engineers inspect metrics (and deviations
                     from expected values) for individual issues and utilize a historical visualization
                     of the affected (and related) issues to obtain insights into the reason for the metric
                     (deviation) and its root cause. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach based
                     on our ProcessInspector prototype providing access to data on four real industry projects
                     and a qualitative evaluation with team leads and group leads from our industry partner.

                  <p>Software development teams dedicate considerable resources to training newcomers.
                     Newcomers are new developers to a software project. The software onboarding process
                     is more complicated than onboarding into other organizations. It is much more challenging
                     and time-consuming. The role of a mentor in onboarding newcomers in software engineering
                     is well understood. However, the disruptions to the work of an experienced developer
                     can reduce the quality of their work and job satisfaction. We propose a conversational
                     bot that can help onboard newcomers to a software project instead of an experienced
                     programmer. The bot will act as a mentor for the newcomer, thus putting less stress
                     on experienced programmers. The bot will also be able to scan outside sources, such
                     as stack overflow, for solutions to issues a newcomer may face. The newcomer will
                     be able to interact with the bot using natural language. We will use this bot to assess

                     to rapidly assess the usage, value and performance of deployed software using data
                     collected from customers and the deployed system. Despite its increasing popularity

                  <p>We investigated in a case study the use of CE practices within several products, teams

                  <p>In continuous integration (CI) environments, the program is rapidly and frequently
                     modified and integrated. This feature introduces significant challenges to testing
                     processes conducted in these environments. Based on existing technology, a test case
                     that fails frequently is likely to fail in future tests. Therefore, the historical
                     execution results of test cases are essential to guide the test case prioritization
                     (TCP) in the CI environment. Reinforcement learning involves solving sequential decision-making
                     problems and is suitable for TCP in the CI environment. At present, most of the TCP
                     techniques based on reinforcement learning rely on the current cycle historical failure
                     information of test cases. They rarely consider more historical cycle information,
                     as well as other influencing factors. In this paper, we discussed the occurrence frequency

                     each test case and proposed three new reward function, which employs the percentage
                     of historical failure and the failure distribution of test cases, which can guide
                     the reinforcement learning process. We evaluate our method on five industrial data
                     sets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively prioritize test
                     cases and improve the cost-effectiveness of the CI process.

                  <p>Pull requests (PRs) selection is a challenging task faced by integrators in pull-based
                     development (PbD), with hundreds of PRs submitted on a daily basis to large open-source
                     projects. Managing these PRs manually consumes integrators' time and resources and
                     may lead to delays in the acceptance, response, or rejection of PRs that can propose
                     bug fixes or feature enhancements. On the one hand, well-known platforms for performing
                     PbD, like GitHub, do not provide built-in recommendation mechanisms for facilitating
                     the management of PRs. On the other hand, prior research on PRs recommendation has
                     focused on the likelihood of either a PR being accepted or receive a response by the
                     integrator. In this paper, we consider both those likelihoods, this to help integrators
                     in the PRs selection process by suggesting to them the appropriate actions to undertake
                     on each specific PR. To this aim, we propose an approach, called CARTESIAN (aCceptance
                     And Response classificaTion-based requESt IdentificAtioN) modeling the PRs recommendation
                     according to PR actions. In particular, CARTESIAN is able to recommend three types
                     of PR actions: accept, respond, and reject. We evaluated CARTESIAN on the PRs of 19
                     popular GitHub projects. The results of our study demonstrate that our approach can
                     identify PR actions with an average precision and recall of about 86%. Moreover, our
                     findings also highlight that CARTESIAN outperforms the results of two baseline approaches
                     in the task of PRs selection.

                  <p>Background: Software Process Simulation Modeling (SPSM) is of paramount importance
                     to support quantitative management of software development process. Hybrid process
                     simulation combines multiple simulation paradigms to reflect complex changes in realistic
                     software processes, which brings inherent challenges to process management. Constructing
                     a hybrid model requires more modeling expertise and experience than modeling by solo-paradigm.
                     However, a few studies explicitly discuss the challenges they encountered as a topic,
                     which may discourage practitioners. Objective: Our aim in this study is to present
                     an industrial process modeling project as an exemplar to demonstrate and discuss the
                     technical issues and challenges associated with hybrid process simulation in practice.
                     Method: Based on the collaboration with a global software enterprise, we constructed
                     a hybrid process simulation model that combines System Dynamics (SD) and Discrete
                     Event Simulation (DES) to predict the project duration and release date for management.
                     Results: Several challenges around hybrid process simulation of software development
                     process are identified and discussed with the proposal of sets of solutions from different
                     perspectives. The model is validated by comparing the simulation result with the actual
                     enactment of the process in industry. In addition, the result confirms the rationality
                     and efficacy of the suggested solutions to some extent. Conclusions: In the collaboration
                     with the enterprise, five-step modeling procedure was adopted for constructing the
                     hybrid process model. The experience reported about the detailed steps of hybrid modeling
                     may offer reference value to the SPSM community.

                  <p>Agile software development methods promise shorter time-to-market and higher product
                     quality, but lack the ability of long-term planning or coping with large projects.
                     However, software companies often also want the ability of long-term planning, promised
                     by traditional or plan-based methods. To benefit from the strengths of both approaches,
                     software companies often use a combination of agile and plan-based methods, known
                     as hybrid development approaches. These approaches strongly depend on the individual
                     context and are customized. Therefore, companies have to organize their hybrid development
                     approach individually. However, practitioners often have difficulties with the organization
                     of hybrid approaches. The organization considers how the phases, activities, roles,
                     and artifacts are arranged and connected. Research lacks the necessary detailed insight
                     into how hybrid development approaches are organized to support practitioners. To
                     gain better understanding of the organization of hybrid approaches, we conducted a
                     systematic literature review to gather descriptions of hybrid approaches. We analyzed
                     the found papers thoroughly and could identify three general patterns of how hybrid
                     approaches are organized. We found that all these patterns are still based on Royce's
                     waterfall model and use the standard software engineering activities. Our findings
                     shall help to lead further research and help practitioners to better organize their
                     individual development approach.

                     adaptive case Management Systems for Knowledge Workers (EcoKnow.org) research project.
                     The approach is based on knowledge from prior ethnographic field studies and research
                     in the declarative Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) technology for model-driven design
                     of case management systems. The approach was tested in an operational environment
                     jointly with the danish municipality of Syddjurs by conducting a service-design project
                     and implementing an open source case manager tool and a new highlighter tool for mapping
                     between textual specifications and the DCR notation. The design method and technologies
                     were evaluated by understandability studies with end-users. The study showed that
                     the development could be done in just 6 months, and that the new highlighter tool
                     in combination with the traditional design and simulation tools, supports domain experts
                     formalise and provide traceability between their interpretations of textual specifications

                  <p>The collection of high-quality data provides a key competitive advantage to companies
                     in their decision-making process. It helps to understand customer behavior and enables
                     the usage and deployment of new technologies based on machine learning. However, the
                     process from collecting the data, to clean and process it to be used by data scientists
                     and applications is often manual, non-optimized and error-prone. This increases the
                     time that the data takes to deliver value for the business. To reduce this time companies
                     are looking into automation and validation of the data processes. Data processes are
                     the operational side of data analytic workflow.
                  </p> 
                  <p>DataOps, a recently coined term by data scientists, data analysts and data engineers
                     refer to a general process aimed to shorten the end-to-end data analytic life-cycle
                     time by introducing automation in the data collection, validation, and verification
                     process. Despite its increasing popularity among practitioners, research on this topic
                     has been limited and does not provide a clear definition for the term or how a data
                     analytic process evolves from ad-hoc data collection to fully automated data analytics
                     as envisioned by DataOps.
                  </p> 
                  <p>This research provides three main contributions. First, utilizing multi-vocal literature
                     we provide a definition and a scope for the general process referred to as DataOps.
                     Second, based on a case study with a large mobile telecommunication organization,
                     we analyze how multiple data analytic teams evolve their infrastructure and processes
                     towards DataOps. Also, we provide a stairway showing the different stages of the evolution
                     process. With this evolution model, companies can identify the stage which they belong
                     to and also, can try to move to the next stage by overcoming the challenges they encounter
                     in the current stage.

                  <p>Development and Operations (DevOps), a particular type of Continuous Software Engineering,
                     has become a popular Software System Engineering paradigm. Software architecture is
                     critical in succeeding with DevOps. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge
                     of how software systems are architected in the industry to enable and support DevOps.
                     Since architectural decisions, along with their rationales and implications, are very
                     important in the architecting process, we performed an industrial case study that
                     has empirically identified and synthesized the key architectural decisions considered
                     essential to DevOps transformation by two software development teams. Our study also
                     reveals that apart from the chosen architecture style, DevOps works best with modular
                     architectures. In addition, we found that the performance of the studied teams can
                     improve in DevOps if operations specialists are added to the teams to perform the
                     operations tasks that require advanced expertise. Finally, investment in testing is
                     inevitable for the teams if they want to release software changes faster.

                  <p>Agile methods were proposed to address the problems of traditional or plan-based software
                     development, e.g., late customer feedback or resistance to change. However, unlike
                     plan-based methods, they are not designed for long-term planning or to cope with large
                     projects. Software companies want the ability of a fast reaction to changes but also
                     the ability of long-term planning. To profit from the strength of both approaches,
                     software companies often use a combination of agile and plan-based methods, called
                     hybrid development approaches. These approaches depend on the respective context of
                     each company. Therefore, the companies have to properly arrange and connect the phases,
                     activities, roles, and artifacts from plan-based and agile approaches individually
                     in their hybrid development approach. This is considered as the organization of hybrid
                     development approaches. However, the organization of hybrid approaches is often difficult
                     for the companies. Until now, research considers only the chosen development methods
                     without the organization of hybrid development approaches. With my work, I want to
                     strengthen the understanding of how hybrid approaches are organized and get a detailed
                     picture of the challenges when organizing hybrid approaches. Based on my findings,

                  <p>Context: Following on other scientific disciplines, such as health sciences, the use
                     of grey literature (GL) is becoming widespread in Software Engineering (SE) research.
                     Whilst the number of papers incorporating GL on SE is increasing, there is little
                     empirically known about different aspects of the use of GL in SE research. In particular,
                     there is a lack of excellent evaluation standard for the quality of GL. Aim: Our research
                     is aimed at systematically reviewing the use of GL in SE, empirically exploring SE
                     researchers' views on GL and providing a guide for using GL in SE and for quality
                     assessment of the GL to be included. Method: We used a mixed-methods approach for
                     this research. We carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the use of GL
                     in SE. Then we surveyed the authors of the papers included in the SLR (as GL users)
                     and the invited experts in the SE community on the use of GL in SE research. Results:
                     We systematically selected and reviewed 102 SE secondary studies that incorporate
                     GL in SE research, from which we identified two groups based on their reporting: 1)
                     76 reviews only claim their use of GL; 2) 26 reviews report the results by including
                     GL. We also obtained 20 replies from the GL users and 24 replies from the invited
                     SE experts. Conclusion: There is no common understanding of the meaning of GL in SE.
                     Researchers define the scopes and the definitions of GL in a variety of ways. We found
                     five main reasons of using GL in SE research. The findings have enabled us to propose
                     a conceptual model for how GL works in SE research lifecycle. In the next workThere
                     is a need for research to develop guidelines for using GL in SE and for assessing
                     quality of GL.
