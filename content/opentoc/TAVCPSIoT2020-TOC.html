                  <p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) play a critical role in automating public infrastructure
                     and thus attract wide range of attacks. Assessing the effectiveness of defense mechanisms
                     is challenging as realistic sets of attacks to test them against are not always available.
                     In this short paper, we briefly describe smart fuzzing, an automated, machine learning
                     guided technique for systematically producing test suites of CPS network attacks.
                     Our approach uses predictive ma- chine learning models and meta-heuristic search algorithms
                     to guide the fuzzing of actuators so as to drive the CPS into different unsafe physical
                     states. The approach has been proven effective on two real-world CPS testbeds.

                  <p>Ptolemy is a modeling and simulation toolkit widely used in cyber physical systems.
                     Formal verification is a very important method to guarantee the correctness of systems.
                     However, the proposed verification approach in Ptolemy is inconvenient and only supports
                     a few actors. In this paper, we present a model translation based approach to verify
                     the Ptolemy Discrete-Event model and implement a plug-in tool in Ptolemy. A set of
                     mapping rules are designed to translate the Ptolemy Discrete-Event model into a network
                     of timed automata. A template library that translates from actors in Ptolemy Discrete-Event
                     model is also built in advance. A case study of traffic lights control system has
                     been successfully translated and verified. The verification results are reliable and
                     valid. The experimental results confirm our approach is useful to verify the Ptolemy
                     Discrete-Event model.
