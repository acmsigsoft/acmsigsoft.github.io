                  <p>Background: Software architecture is a crucial while significantly challenging topic in the computer
                     science curriculum. Although "learning by doing" is widely advocated to address this
                     topic's abstract and fuzzy nature, educators are still facing various difficulties
                     in practice, especially including students' vicious circle of inexperience and the
                     mental model dilemma in experiential learning.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Aims: To help break the aforementioned vicious circle and mental model dilemma, this work
                     aims to investigate our educational strategy of using lightweight projects with public
                     and free PaaS resources (1) to help students accumulate architectural experience from
                     the early stage and (2) to facilitate strengthening students' fundamental architecture
                     knowledge.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Method: To collect more empirical evidence, we conducted action research on our educational
                     strategy across three undergraduate-curriculum courses for two years. In particular,
                     we employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to validate how well students received
                     such an educational strategy.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Results: The students involved in the relevant coursework generally gave positive feedback
                     with respect to learning theoretical concepts and a set of architectural patterns.
                     Meanwhile, we also observed diverse learning curves for utilizing PaaS resources.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Conclusions: Although there still exist PaaS-related limits, our educational strategy can foster
                     students' experiential learning and collaborative learning in fundamental architecture
                     courses. We believe that there are also potentials to extend our work to broader and
                     advanced courses of software architecture.

                  <p>Modeling is an important skill in software engineering. However, it is often not tangible
                     for students and not appreciated. Students prefer coding because they receive immediate
                     feedback from the compiler. Engaging students in modeling is difficult, especially
                     in large introductory courses.
                  </p> 
                  <p>We have developed an interactive learning method for modeling which is based on an
                     easy to use online editor. Students learn modeling in guided tutorials in the lecture
                     right after the theory is introduced and deepen their modeling skills in group work
                     and homework exercises. This learning method was applied in a large introductory course
                     with more than 1000 students.
                  </p> 
                  <p>An empirical evaluation of the method demonstrated that the students' learning outcome
                     in modeling improved significantly by up to 87 %. Students are motivated to use models
                     in their future projects and understand how to approach problems with models. The
                     use of interactive models in programming exercises improves their understanding of
                     the taught concepts.

                  <p>In this paper, we describe the design tracing strategy, which enables students to
                     comprehend class and sequence diagrams by tracing different scenarios. In design tracing,
                     for a given scenario, students identify relevant variables from the class diagram,
                     relevant events from the sequence diagram and trace the flow of these data variables
                     and events by constructing a state diagram. We have developed a web-based learning
                     environment - VeriSIM, which trains students to apply the design tracing strategy.
                     We conducted a study where 86 final-year undergraduates interacted with VeriSIM. Findings
                     from the pre-test and post-test show that students are able to trace a given scenario
                     by identifying relevant variables and events and are able to simulate change of state
                     for these variables. A focus-group interview was also conducted with 13 participants
                     in order to understand their perception of the usefulness of design tracing. A thematic
                     analysis of the focus-group interview showed that students perceived design tracing
                     helped them understand the relationship between different diagrams and identify different
                     scenarios in the design. Interaction with VeriSIM also helped students understand
                     the usefulness of creating class and sequence diagrams. These results show that design
                     tracing can be a useful pedagogy to help learners form an integrated and correct understanding
                     of class and sequence design diagrams.

                  <p>Automated grading systems provide feedback to students in a variety of ways, but they
                     typically focus on identifying incorrect program behaviors. Such systems provide notices
                     of test case failures or runtime errors, but without debugging skills, students often
                     become frustrated when they don't know where to start addressing these defects. Borrowing
                     from work in software engineering research related to automated defect location, we
                     leverage previous research describes using statistical fault localization (SFL) techniques
                     to identify the probable locations of defects in student coding assignments. The goal
                     is to use these SFL techniques to provide a scaffold for students, to direct their
                     debugging efforts without giving too much guidance, and thus minimizing the learning
                     associated with investigating the defects. After determining the "suspiciousness"
                     for each line of code involved in the defect, we create a "heat map" visualization
                     overlay onto their source code of the "suspiciousness" scores to visually guide a
                     student's attention to parts of their code that are most likely to contain problems.
                  </p> 
                  <p>This paper describes the results of an analysis comparing two semesters of <em>CS 1114: Introduction to Software Design</em> (CS1) students, one which had access to the heat map feedback (Fall 2017: n~170),
                     and one that did not (Fall 2015: n~270). The results show that when the heat maps
                     were available, students found it easier to make improvements on their code from submission
                     to submission, as well as spending less time overall achieving the maximum score on
                     the instructor testing assessments. In fact, while we were optimistic in the impact
                     of the heat map feedback, the results we observed were unexpectedly strong. To address
                     this concern, we conducted an additional study, using student submissions from our
                     Spring 2019 CS 1 students (n~230). The results of the second analysis confirmed the
                     results of the first.

                  <p>Software engineers have significant expertise to offer when building intelligent systems,
                     drawing on decades of experience and methods for building systems that are scalable,
                     responsive and robust, even when built on unreliable components. Systems with artificial-intelligence
                     or machine-learning (ML) components raise new challenges and require careful engineering.
                     We designed a new course to teach software-engineering skills to students with a background
                     in ML. We specifically go beyond traditional ML courses that teach modeling techniques
                     under artificial conditions and focus, in lecture and assignments, on realism with
                     large and changing datasets, robust and evolvable infrastructure, and purposeful requirements

                  <p>Studies indicate that much of the software created today is not accessible to all
                     users, indicating that developers don't see the need to devote sufficient resources
                     to creating accessible software. Compounding this problem, there is a lack of robust,
                     easily adoptable educational accessibility material available to instructors for inclusion
                     in their curricula. To address these issues, we have created five <em>Accessibility Learning Labs</em> (ALL) using an experiential learning structure. The labs are designed to educate
                     and create awareness of accessibility needs in computing. The labs enable easy classroom
                     integration by providing instructors with complete educational materials including
                     lecture slides, activities, and quizzes. The labs are hosted on our servers and require
                     only a browser to be utilized.

                  <p>The employment opportunity for Computer Science (CS), Information Technology and Software
                     Engineering and Development (SE) related occupations is projected to grow much faster
                     than the average of all other occupations. Therefore, increase in student enrollment,
                     retention and graduation rate is becoming very important, so is the need for effective
                     teaching in these subjects. Many universities commonly use formal, institutional Student
                     Evaluation of Teaching (SET) systems to measure the teaching effectiveness. After
                     each semester, through SET, students provide feedback and comments for their courses
                     and instructors. However, evaluations are private and only a handful people have access
                     to these. Therefore, these evaluations cannot be utilized to create a common understanding
                     of the students' expectations, perspective, desired characteristics of the courses
                     and instructors. On the other hand, third party online platforms like RateMyProfessor.com
                     (RMP) are public, solicit anonymous student feedback and host tremendous amount of
                     data about the instructors and their courses. These platforms are also popular among
                     students. We mined and analyzed the RMP data for some research questions, e.g.: What
                     are the common characteristics of the popular CS instructors? How different are they
                     for the SE instructors? Are there any examples of special characteristics, tools and
                     techniques popular CS instructors use? We captured and analyzed more than 9,000 students'
                     comments for over 300 CS instructors for the top 20 universities in the U.S. and Canada.
                     The paper contributes by presenting the findings for the research questions and making
                     the data and the scripts available for public use for future research.

                  <p>In order to give students an authentic learning experience and better prepare them
                     for the life-long learning required in contemporary workplaces, educational institutions
                     increasingly use project-based learning in teams. However, this poses the challenge
                     of developing authentic and equitable assessment criteria that reflect individual
                     contributions in a team-work setting without jeopardizing project outcomes. We present
                     a novel and innovative portfolio-based assessment framework that focuses on qualitative
                     outcomes and ensures that the level of achievement reflects a student's competency
                     across each of the defined learning dimensions, including professional behaviour,
                     teamwork, process and relevant contributions towards project deliverables. In this
                     paper, we present the main motivation behind devising and introducing the framework
                     and also reflect on the educational outcomes and challenges of implementing the framework
                     in the context of two final year Software Engineering project units.

                  <p>When computations consist of different processes or threads that may execute at the
                     same time or in an interleaved manner, we say the computation is concurrent or that
                     it exhibits concurrency. University students often struggle to reason about concurrency.
                     Researchers have presented students with natural language descriptions of scenarios
                     involving concurrency and have evaluated students' natural language responses to explore
                     their prior knowledge and to determine characteristics of student reasoning about
                     concurrency. However, natural language responses are necessarily abstract and pertain
                     to the design stage of software development, while studies in which students are asked
                     to implement solutions provide a more concrete view of student reasoning and reveal
                     difficulties that arise when putting design into practice. In this work we build upon
                     prior work and ask: What are common and problematic features in student approaches
                     to solving concurrency-related problems? How do these features differ from the design
                     phase to the implementation phase of the software development life cycle? In this
                     study we asked students enrolled in a jointly offered upper division undergraduate
                     / MS level course on "Programming with Concurrency" to implement a solution to the
                     same problem (a sidekick/superhero version of the party matching problem) using two
                     different approaches: Threads-based in Java, and Actors-based in Scala. We performed
                     qualitative feature analysis of their implementations and their written reflections
                     to better understand student reasoning when programming concurrent solutions. The
                     feature of <em>additional complexity</em> was found in our earlier natural language study in which students described their
                     designs. Additional complexity was also represented in student implementations in
                     this study and adversely impacted student success as their programs became cumbersome
                     and hard to trace. Student reflections provided insight into their resistance to modeling
                     prior to implementation, and indicated that they found formal modeling techniques
                     difficult. These findings suggest that lighter weight interventions that address student
                     difficulties earlier in the development process may be more palatable to students
                     and thus have substantial impact.

                  <p>Finland is considered a country with a good track record in gender equality. Whilst
                     statistics support the notion that Finland is performing well compared to many other
                     countries in terms of workplace equality, there are still many areas for improvement.
                     This paper focuses on the problems that some women face in obtaining software engineering
                     roles. We report a preliminary analysis of survey data from 252 respondents. These
                     are mainly women who have shown an interest in gaining programming roles by joining
                     the Mimmit koodaa initiative, which aims to increase equality and diversity within
                     the software industry. The survey sought to understand what early experiences may
                     influence later career choices and feelings of efficacy and confidence needed to pursue
                     technology-related careers. These initial findings reveal that women's feelings of
                     computing self-efficacy and attitudes towards software engineering are shaped by early
                     experiences. More negative experiences decrease the likelihood of working in software
                     engineering roles in the future, despite expressing an interest in the field.

                  <p>DevOps stands for Development-Operations. It arises from the IT industry as a movement
                     aligning development and operations teams. DevOps is broadly recognized as an IT standard,
                     and there is high demand for DevOps practitioners in industry. Since ACM &amp; IEEE suggest
                     that undergraduate computer science curricula "must adequately prepare [students]
                     for the workforce", we studied whether undergraduates acquired adequate DevOps skills
                     to fulfill the demand for DevOps practitioners in industry. We employed Grounded Theory
                     (GT), a social science qualitative research methodology, to study DevOps education
                     from academic and industrial perspectives. In academia, academics were not motivated
                     to learn or adopt DevOps, and we did not find strong evidence of academics teaching
                     DevOps. Academics need incentives to adopt DevOps, in order to stimulate interest
                     in teaching DevOps. In industry, DevOps practitioners lack clearly defined roles and
                     responsibilities, for the DevOps topic is diverse and growing too fast. Therefore,
                     practitioners can only learn DevOps through hands-on working experience. As a result,
                     academic institutions should provide fundamental DevOps education (in culture, procedure,
                     and technology) to prepare students for their future DevOps advancement in industry.
                     Based on our findings, we proposed five groups of future studies to advance DevOps
                     education in academia.

                     model for a final-year capstone program in Software Engineering. The model developed
                     is motivated by having real (and developing) software artifacts with incrementally
                     changing team members working on a product-line. This in turn results in more sophisticated

                     promotes, through its internal organization, leadership and personal responsibility.
                     The students are supported by professional software engineers, up-skilling workshops,
                     and academic supervisors who act as a personalized reporting and grading point for

                  <p>Students face difficulties when transitioning from introductory programming to using
                     more complex enterprise technologies, such as libraries, software frameworks and development
                     kits. Whilst much literature has been devoted to how to teach introductory programming
                     effectively, less attention is devoted towards managing the transition towards more
                     complex technologies. This work presents the design, experience and evaluation of
                     a module that engages students with a range of enterprise technologies. The module
                     uses peer teaching to transfer the responsibility to students for teaching each other
                     about the technologies. As such, this reduces the need for the teacher to invest time
                     in preparing materials, and it is feasible to cover more technologies depending upon
                     the number of teaching teams. The evaluation, conducted on a cohort of 34 students
                     studying six enterprise technologies over the course of one week, revealed overwhelmingly
                     positive experiences with this approach. For the teacher, effort for preparation and
                     delivery was minimal, and the feedback on the module was highly positive.

                     generated examples or analogies that guide towards the correct solution. We report
                     empirical results from a large-scale (N = 480, 10,000 + person hour) experiment assessing
                     the efficacy of these automated compilation-error feedback tools. Using the survival
                     analysis on error rates of students measured over seven weeks, we found that automated
                     feedback allows students to resolve errors in their code more efficiently than students
                     receiving manual feedback. However, we also found that this advantage is primarily
                     logistical and not conceptual; the performance benefit seen during lab assignments
                     disappeared during exams wherein feedback of any kind was withdrawn. We further found
                     that the performance advantage of automated feedback over human tutors increases with
                     problem complexity, and that feedback via example and specific repair have distinct,
                     non-overlapping relative advantages for different categories of programming errors.
                     Our results offer a clear and granular delimitation of the pedagogical benefits of
                     automated feedback in teaching programming to novices.

                  <p>The mobile market is growing every year, creating a demand for mission-critical and
                     innovative enterprises, and personal applications. This demand implies the need for
                     skills training necessary for students to enter the professional development market.
                     The Innovation, Development and Teaching in Complex Software Environments approach
                     (IDEAS) was developed for the training of mobile developers to meet this need, through
                     an innovative process for student selection, training through the active methodology
                     Challenge Based Learning, software production, and startups creation. The approach
                     was created through action-research applied during two cycles of a real project in
                     a university environment, where 398 students applied for the first cycle, of which
                     110 were selected, and 900 applied for the second cycle, of which 100 were selected.
                     We undertook evaluations with students and teachers through periodic reflections,
                     questionnaires, and interviews at the end of each cycle. Some of the positive results
                     included the prominence of 125 professional-looking apps that were finalized and published,
                     report of dropout reduction and disapproval in the programming courses and experience
                     in entrepreneurship and pre-acceleration startup program.

                  <p>Modeling is a core topic in Software Engineering Education. Nevertheless, students
                     face difficulties while learning software modeling. To teach software modeling effectively
                     in computing courses, instructors who usually employed traditional methods could use
                     active learning strategies. However, instructors are reluctant to change their teaching
                     approaches due to several barriers that hinder the application of active learning
                     strategies. Besides, relatively little research addresses how to mitigate them. The
                     objective of this research is to help instructors implementing active learning strategies
                     when teaching software modeling with UML diagrams. To achieve this objective, we conducted
                     a Design Science Research (DSR). We proposed an artifact called OpenSMALS, an Open
                     Repository for teaching Software Modeling applying Active Learning Strategies. OpenSMALS
                     provides specific guidelines on how instructors can apply these strategies and helping
                     instructors to identify the active learning strategies best suit their teaching context.
                     We performed four DSR Design Cycles---in four different universities---to evaluate
                     and evolve OpenSMALS. Our results show that OpenSMALS satisfactorily reduced the barriers
                     faced by instructors, and it achieved an appropriate maturity level to be adopted
                     by other instructors.

                  <p>Introductory programming is challenging for many students, requiring them to engage
                     with a deep approach to learning concepts in order to succeed. These challenges compound
                     for online students who do not have direct face-to-face interactions with teaching
                     staff. With the growing demand for online education, we need to examine approaches
                     that assist in building supportive learning environments for these students. A growing
                     body of work from other education disciplines indicates that audio feedback provides
                     an opportunity for developing stronger relationships with students. Further studies
                     recommend an integrated implementation of audio recording into the virtual learning
                     environment. To evaluate audio feedback for use in programming education, we developed
                     an integrated, cross-browser audio feedback feature into the open-source Doubtfire
                     learning management system. Doubtfire is used to support and scale a task-oriented
                     teaching and learning system built upon the principles of constructive alignment and
                     has been shown to help students engage with programming concepts in campus-only units.
                     Our findings from experimental and observational activities indicate that programming
                     tutors can use a blended approach of audio and text feedback via the learning management
                     system to better support student learning. The blended approach provides more nuanced
                     feedback, conveying personality and feelings of connectedness to students, while retaining
                     the benefits of specificity for code-specific issues.

                  <p>Serious games have become a popular alternative learning tool for computer programming
                     education. Research has shown that serious games provide benefits including the development
                     of problem solving skills and increased engagement in the learning process. Despite
                     the benefits, a major challenge of developing serious games is their ability to accommodate
                     students with different educational backgrounds and levels of competency. Learners
                     with a high-level of competence may find a serious games to be too easy or boring,
                     while learners with low-level competence may be frequently frustrated or find it difficult
                     to progress through the game. One solution to this challenge is to use automated adaptation
                     that can alter game content and adjust game tasks to a level appropriate for the learner.
                     The use of adaptation has been successfully utilized in educational domains outside
                     of Software Engineering, but has not been applied to serious programming games. This
                     paper presents GidgetML, an adaptive version of the Gidget programming game, that
                     uses machine learning to modify game tasks based on assessing and predicting learners'
                     competencies. To assess the benefits of adaptation, we have conducted a study involving
                     100 students in a first-year university programming course. Our study compared the
                     use of Gidget (non-adaptive) with GidgetML (adaptive) and found that students who
                     played Gidget during lab sessions varied significantly in their performance while
                     this variance was significantly reduced for students who played GidgetML.

                  <p>Analysis, modeling and design activities are integral parts of any modern software
                     development project. However, educators often struggle in convincing undergraduate
                     students of their value. Grasping the importance of good software design requires
                     a certain maturity that is not yet attained in the first years of a computer science
                     curriculum. In this study, we introduce group shuffling dynamics to a formal software
                     design course to convey the importance of these concepts by exposing students to the
                     experience of switching groups mid-semester. This grants a whole new perspective on
                     the matter as the cost of managing technical debt is felt when the respective developers
                     leave, and modeling artifacts become pivotal in aiding the incorporation of new team
                     members. This short paper presents our first experience while implementing this methodology
