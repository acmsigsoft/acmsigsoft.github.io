Yet, the contributions of an educator often go unnoticed, except perhaps by those closest to the educator. The SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award is presented annually to an educator or educators who have made significant contributions to, and impact on, the field of software engineering with his or her accomplishments as a teacher, mentor, researcher (in education or learning), author, and/or policy maker. The award may be made to multiple collaborators for joint contributions, such as a co-authored text book.</p><p>The award recipients share a $1000 honorarium, and each recipient receives a plaque engraved with their name and signed by the chair of SIGSOFT. The award is presented by the SIGSOFT chair at ICSE during ICSE&rsquo;s award presentation session. Each award recipient also receives support for travel to ICSE up to $2500 within their home continent and up to $3000 outside their home continent, including airfare, hotel, and conference registration for ICSE.</p><p>To submit a nomination for the award, please use the awards nomination portal. Nominations are due no later than January 15 of each year. Among other details, the nominator needs to submit the following through the portal:</p><ol><li>The proposed citation (up to 25 words)</li><li>Succinct description of why the nominee is well-qualified for the award (100-250 words)</li><li>Detailed nomination statement (no length limit, but please be reasonable) that includes the following sentence: &ldquo;To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM&rsquo;s Core Values.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>The nominator also needs to upload up to 3 support letters (200-300 words will be sufficient for each support letter, although longer statements of support are of course welcome). Each support letter must include the following sentence: &ldquo;To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM&rsquo;s Core Values.&rdquo;</p><p>The selection committee shall have the option to decline to make an award in a given year, if no suitable nominations are presented.
